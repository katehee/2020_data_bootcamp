0,Dmitry,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2019",This is very dangerous product ! Do not buy !,"  I've been buying this product for a year, I bought it many times and I would definetely give it 5 start, but...  today when I was enjoying it something very sharp stack deep inside of my tongue.It was piece of very thin still wire of about 0.4 inch of length. It was definitely inside of the seaweed sheet. At first I thought that it is a fish bone in ut it was wire. I'm scared to death now. I was not expecting this to happen. This thing is very very dangerous. I hardly can image what could have happened if I swallowed it. Also I was used to give it to my kids...DO NOT BUY, THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS PRODUCT !!!"
1,S A,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2018",Bug eggs in package?!!,  Thsee don't expire until December. I opened this up today and found what looks like bug eggs. Disgusting. I'm going to have to throw out all the rest now. This was sealed still too so the bug must've got in during initial packaging.
2,Elisa S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2018",#1 on my list,"  The photo shows the seaweed brands I've tried in order of preference.Jayone: crisp and lightly salted. Delicious at a bargain price. These are great with a meal or just to satisfy those evening cravings. I also cut them up and take them to the theatre in place of popcorn. These are a tiny bit saltier than the gimMe brand.gimMe: very similar if not quite as salty as the Jayone, just a little more expensive and slightly more oil. They seem to flake a little more than the Jayone, but are still very good. I do like having the option to buy 10g trays or 5g trays for taking along as a snack or addition to a meal.Black Label Gourmet: driest and least salty of the bunch, but still a nice crunch. A little different flavor because they're roasted with olive oil instead of sesame or sunflower. They taste a little less sea-like and a little more earthy. These are the ones I like to use to roll salmon or tuna.Wickedly Prime: I can't recommend these at all. Though they supposedly have less salt than a couple of the other brands, they are terribly greasy and taste so salty I couldn't eat them; neither could my family. The only thing I can think to do with them is rinse them and re-roast them to see if they improve. Definitely not worth buying."
3,Ani_Mon,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2017",Oily and stale,"  The first time I bought these I fell in love.. out of all 10 types of seaweed snacks I have tried, these were the best. The difference was that the first time I ordered through Amazon fresh, not this time, so I'm sure the seller is different. Well, these seaweed snacks are horrible. Oily, the flavor is awful, and stake. Check the pictures out where the oil is dripping inside the packaging."
4,Rachel Humphrey,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 4, 2017",The BEST seasoned seaweed makers in the WORLD,"  I ate the entire box in a week. This stuff is DELICIOUS. If you enjoy traditional Korean seaweed, this is it, folks. I've tried several American made brands and they all use WAY too much oil or the seaweed is too thick. This seaweed is perfectly thin and crumbly, salted and lightly seasoned with oils. The pouches arrived the original 24 pack box that was inside an amazon box. I appreciated the Amazon box as I don't want someone to see I have delicious seaweed and decide to take it. I felt like the snack packs had a generous amount of seaweed in them, compared to other snack packs I've tried. One pouch would definitely be great for a rice bowl, udon or just in between classes. Mmm so good."
5,GP,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2017",This batch smelled and tasted like gasoline.,"  This batch smelled and tasted like gasoline...very bizarre.  My kids sniffed it and would not touch it, and I tasted a piece to confirm the packs were ""off"".  Disgusting.  Threw out the whole box"
6,Liam Theis,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2016",A lot of seaweed for the price!,"  I bought this seaweed as a snack food not for sushi, so I can't answer any questions or have any input towards it's position in sushi or rice. I eat it like I'd eat potato chips.I don't think I understood how much seaweed I was getting for the price. I've neever had seaweed and I've never bought it in person so I had no expectations. The massive box showed up filled with a ton of snack pack sized seaweed crisps. My initial taste test of it was not great since I didn't like it too much but it eventually grew on me. If you're new to it or you're feeding it to kids, it takes a couple of tries to know if you like it or not. The packages are easy to open, just tear them like any other snacckfood, and take out the little tray full of sheets.The sheets are a little greasy from whatever processing happens, this isn't an issue at all but I figured I'd mention it. A friend of mine that eats similar products more reguarly figured they needed more salt but they are clearly labeled ""Lightly salted"". Avoid the moisture absorber at the bottom of each pack and you're good to go. This tasty snack will stick in your teeth and affect breath so rinsing your mouth out after eating would be advisable.Pros: Tons of seaweed for the price, Good quality and healthy snack, easy to open.Cons: Slightly greasy, can affect breath/teeth"
7,okbye,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 6, 2017",Good size snack and very healthy.,"  As someone who has never tried seaweed before these took a minute to get used to. They are thin sheets of dried seaweed in a little plastic tray, in single serving packs. There's a bit of a waste of packaging but I guess there isn't another way to do it without breaking them up. They are kind of fragile. The serving size is generous and very few calories. I got used to the taste by the 2nd or 3rd sheet. It's a little spinachy, that's probably the closest thing I can think of in taste. Not strong though. They aren't terribly filling but they take some time to eat and make for a good snack."
8,Donnie,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2020",Sanitation procedures,"  I was okay with this product, the taste was fine, etc., but I wasn't okay when I found a big black hair in the seaweed package.  With this in mind, I threw-out nearly an entire order (box) of seaweed in the trash.  Obviously this company doesn't adhere to it's sanitation procedures or rules.  That is disgusting!!!  I forgot to take a picture of that as I was disgusted out of my mind when I found it.  Will look elsewhere for a seaweed product.  Would not recommend."
9,benjamin bannister,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2017",Light On Salt and Texture,"  I am a fan of seaweed snacks and have tried many. This package was okay in terms of overall quality.It is lightly salted as described for those looking to lessen their salt intake. The portions could be bigger because after you're done with a pack you still want more. The texture is really flat (I'm used to bumps and shapes), so it feels like eating flat salted sea chips.This wasn't good enough for me to buy again, but for those looking for a less salty version of a seaweed snack, it may be for you."
10,Margaret,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2020",Most expensive bag of chips ever.,"  Delicious, but who would pay $16 for a bag of chips, really? I thought I was getting a case for that price!"
11,Laura J Armstrong,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 31, 2020",A scam,  I love these chips but feel ripped off as I thought BULk meant several bags. This out landing price resulted in just 1 bag.
12,Stacey,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2020","""BULK"" lol","  These are the best snacks ever..... However, just know that they are charging $15-$16 for ONE normal size bag.. even though they are making it sound like it is worth that much."
13,Theresa,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 14, 2020",Misleading and unsatisfied,  COMPLETE RIP OFF and Misleading. It’s says bulk. You can get a bag this size at Costco for $8
14,Calvin Dean,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2020",Appetite suppressant,  This is the absolute nastiest thing I’ve ever tasted in my life. It works great as an appetite suppressant due to the totally foul taste that is left in your mouth. I’d never buy it again but if you like the taste of fish that’s baked in the sun for 4 weeks this is for you!
15,GG Mclaughlin,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2020",A great light snack if you like seaweed,"  These seaweed crisps make a wonderful grab a handful snack.  They are lightly salted, non greasy and a perfect cure for the munchies."

21,Julia,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2020",Great snacking food!!,  Loved this!! It was a great snacking food and a great alternative to popcorn when watching a movie :)
22,Brenda Barnes,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2020",Will definitely buy more,  These are delicious
23,Elizabeth Miller,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2020",Rosemary Oleoresin as an ingredient - be careful,"  I was very hopeful this snack would be wonderful. I liked them. Not terrific, but sort of what is expected when you combine seaweed, salt, rice crackers, and sugar. My objection is about 20 minutes after having a handful I was very hot. And I recalled how there is an odd aftertaste, reminiscent of MSG on the tongue. I checked the ingredients. No MSG. But it does list Rosemary Oleoresin. I Googled this additive and found this: Rosemary Oleoresin is a circulatory and nerve stimulant. Interesting. I definitely did not like the hot flushed sensations and won't be buying this again."
24,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2019",Delish,"  I have tried many brands of seaweed snacks over the years and I usually buy them when I want to try ""healthy snacking"" but don't stick with them for long. I bought these expecting to abandon them after a few servings, but something about these are different...they are addicting. I don't know what it is, but these are just so dang good. Just the right amount of salt, crispness, and the ""ocean-y"" aftertaste is goes away pretty quickly. I knew something was superior about these seaweed snacks when I was eating kettle chips and felt unsatisfied because I wanted these seaweed snacks instead. I'm going to buy more!"
25,Cheryl Erickson,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 18, 2018",DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY - BUY IN STORE!,"  This is a better deal ounce per ounce, pack for pack, any way you look at it it’s a better deal TO BUY THIS IN STORE!!! There were like 5 seaweed sheets PER PACK!! Never will purchase again!"
26,the buudha,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2019",received the bad batch,  Looovvee these! Much better than the Costco / Kirkland brandUpdate: Received a new batch which was oily and rubbery. Not like any of the previous patches that I've received.  Contacted Amazon about it waiting for a responseUpdate 2:. Amazon sent out a new batch after this review.  It arrived pretty much the next day - it was much better!
27,Interliner,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 22, 2020",Ok but Watch Out For Silicone Beads,  I love seaweed and this tastes alright: Check each pack before you eat Each pack contains a small pack of silicone beads at the bottom  for freshness. I was eating this and suddenly bit on something hard. It turns out the little silicone pack had a hole in it and the beads were on the seaweed. I hate that I ate some of the beads before I realized what I was eating.
28,Cynthia Smith,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 23, 2020",Allergen information changed,"  I have ordered these several times. Loved them. But this time, they are listed as being made in shared equipment with soy and sesame- in which I am both allergic to. And this is not updated on the listing. Waste of money."
29,Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2019",Sorry..hated them,  Don't understand the good reviews...they were disgusting.  The whole pack went in the garbage.  I bought them because sea weed was recommended as a healthy snack. Ate first pack and hated them.  Decided to try a second pack to be fair and they were no better.  If there is a sea weed item that is better would love to know it.  My stomach didn't like this one...
30,Irene Peterson,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 22, 2019",pretty discusting,"  terrible flavor and aftertaste, very fishy!. Tried a couple and that was it. Now I have 19 packages of disgusting product. Don't believe I can return these. Was so hoping these would be helpful on keto diet but I cannot stomach these. Can't understand why they got pretty good reviews."
31,E. Morris,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2020",GREAT price,  I was paying $1.99 for a single one of theses! Was worried that he hear would he out of date or something because the price was so low...like $1.25 less per pack! But they aren’t stale. They are just like what I’ve been buying just much less expensive!
32,Keith Ong,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2020","Best thing i can say, 'It tastes like seaweed'. Worse thing i can say, ""'It tastes like seaweed'.","  Instead of heading to the local H-Mart (Korean supermarket chain in US) just to pickup seaweed, I decided to look and buy it online. I was concerned after reading some reviews and wondered whether or not there was going to be any difference between this brand and the ones we normally purchase. As my 9 year old was taste testing it, I asked how does this compare to all the other brands we buy.  The reply was, 'It tastes like seaweed'.  Happy to say, kid approved. Just to be sure I grabbed a slice and sure enough, it tastes just like all other brands we have bought. Would I buy it again? I just did!"
33,Judi,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2019",The Best Seaweed,"  They are the best seaweed I have bought. There are 20 small packs in each bag and about 10 pieces in each small package . They are a little greasy (from the sunflower oil) but I guess that's why they are so good. Since each package has only 25 calories, who cares! They are from Korea but packaged in American/California (with all the information in English) and totally organic and a great bargain."
34,Cindy Kerwin,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2020",Flavor is good but SO MUCH SALT!,"  I would've given these 5 stars but OMG - all the salt! I can literally see big coarse ground chunks of salt all over each piece! And its not just a little salt, it covers each piece. I tried to brush it off but that doesn't work with such a thin flimsy piece of seaweed. I have high blood pressure so I stay away from salt, which is ok because I'm fond of it to begin with. I usually buy Seasnax toasted onion which I LOVE! (no chunks or visible salt on theirs) I thought I would stray and try a new brand and came up wanting. If they got rid of all the salt, I would probably buy again, but now I'm just stuck with a bunch of snacks I can't eat."
35,DJ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2020",I didn't think I would like it.  Quickly acquired taste.,"  I am addicted to this stuff even though I thought I was crazy for buying it.  The first few sheets tasted kind of funny because I never liked the smell of seaweed, but I got through it because of the salt and the teriyaki sauce.  Then I started to crave more.  The texture takes your mouth on journey.  The seaweed first starts out crispy like a chip, then it quickly hits the saliva and then feels like a wet, very thin piece of paper.  Then it gets slightly chewy like beef jerky.  Then out of no where, the sheet disappears.  Ha!  I love how it only has one carb per package.  I usually eat 2-3 packages per sitting.  I need to look for a version that has larger servings."
36,N,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2019",Less Flavorful than Any other Seaweed Snacks,"  Wow!  Considering the popularity of this brand, I never would have guessed I'd find myself writing this review.  Great texture but I seriously thought that I had been sent the wrong kind - I ordered sea salt and would have guessed it was the olive oil flavor.  Maybe I got a bad batch.  It's funny because I had just tried another brand and thought they weren;t flavorful but oh boy do they shine in comparison to these.  Good in soup, though."
37,Wili1,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 27, 2020","25 calories per packet, good price","  These make wonderful snacks especially if you’re craving a little salt as they are a bit salty.  You might find yourself drinking more beer or other beverages while eating these.  (Just like when you eat pretzels or chips at a bar).  The size is perfect for a box or bag lunch but I always wish I had more sheets of nori (the seaweed) once I reach the bottom of the packet.  They’re addictive!  At 25 calories and a single serving per package, it seems that it’s be a good food to eat during a diet.  The inner clear container is recyclable (I can see the recycling symbol on it but can’t read what type of plastic it is.  I think it may be in Asian letters). I like to keep a couple in my car for snacks on-the-go.  At 62 cents a package, it’s at least half the price I’d pay at the grocery store and that’s when it’s on sale."

39,Abby Mendonca,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2019",I love them,"  Delicious! I’ve been doing keto for a while know and these are crispy, and yummy and low carb and calorie. I can’t get enough (obviously I order the 20 pack). They satisfy and are so easy to take with me. I eat at least 1 pack a day. Also, the FLAVOR is AMAZING. They are so salty and tangy and taste so good. I get excited when it is finally time for me to eat them and have to hold back from eating them right after breakfast. I think this is the best flavor, but sesame and sea salt are good as well."
40,Kia Smiaz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 12, 2019",Great taste,  Delicious and crispy. My kids devour them. Can’t keep up. I just wish so much plastic wasn’t wasted. Each set is in its own individual plastic box. Not necessary. I’ve bought seaweed strips that come in flat packaging and they were great. Once in a while stuck together but worth not wasting so much plastic.
41,MyssLynx,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2020",Yummy!!,  These are so good! I couldn’t stop eating them. I was having 5 packs in a sitting!! I just felt bad about all the packaging. I wish there was a bigger container of them so I didn’t have all that plastic.

44,Bruno Devlin,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2019",Nasty Fishy aftertaste,  So sorry I ordered this product.  It is absolutely nasty with a bad fishy aftertaste that will stay with you for hours.  Would not recommend this product to anyone especially for some child to take to school as a snack - OMG!
45,MiaBella,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2020",Gross and made in same place as SOY products,  These smell gross plus I can not eat them due to my soy allergy. They should really make it known they are made in the same factory as soy products. Now its a waste of money. My husband can not stomach them. They are thin like a Listerine breath strip.  So the nasty fishy taste gets absorbed all over your tongue. He had to brush and use mouthwash to get the taste out.We had other seaweed products and they did not taste nor smell like this.
46,JSmith,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2020",Delicious Healthy Snack,"  I avoid high carb, due to the spike in energy. But too many nuts are way too high in calories because I am also trying not to gain weight and if possible would prefer to lose some. So what snacks are low carb and low fat?

48,Jenna S.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 18, 2020","Great snacks, but price drastically changes","  When I first bought this, it was half the price at our grocery. So this is definitely better value on Amazon. A bit disappointed though that it has gone up by $5 in a just a few weeks.Overall, these are yummy and healthy snacks. Every now and then, you get an oily pack, but generally most are just right."
49,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 29, 2020",Teriyaki flavor is great!,"  I've been eating roasted seaweed for a couple years (mostly Jayone) - it's great when I feel like eating something but am not particularly hungry, as it's very low in calories and won't make me feel stuffed.I'd gotten kind of tired of the standard salted flavor so this teriyaki version is a great treat! It has a pronounced teriyaki flavor, and at least on the first day of eating it the seaweed was crisp and tasted fresh (as fresh as one can expect from dried seaweed - point is, it wasn't rancid).Significantly more expensive than Jayone, but they don't make teriyaki."
50,KLDH,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2020",Addicting!,"  Now when I first tried these I was a bit skeptical because I have never had a seaweed snack before so the flavor was very different for me.  The more I continued to eat the pack, the more hooked I became!  Now I absolutely love them and they have pretty much replaced my potato chips as a snack.  The saltiness and crunch is mainly what I enjoy when I have chips so this is a much healthier alternative.  I will continue to buy these little bundles of goodness!!"
51,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2018",Great,"  This is the best tasting olive oil seaweed I’ve ever had.

52,Sand Box,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2020",The teriyaki flavor is delicious & low in Weight Watchers points!,"  This was a spontaneous purchase, I bought the teriyaki flavor & they are great! A package only has 1 Weight Watchers point for those who follow WW, this is a very good thing. Low in sodium & good for you. Organic too. They are tasty & addicting! I have tried other seaweed products & not liked them, but I love these."
53,J. Haley,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 4, 2020",Not the snack I had hoped for,"  I had hoped to eat these as a snack but they were truly awful. After the first bite, I didn't want to eat another bite. I forced myself to continue eating but they still did not get any better. Would certainly not buy these again in the future."
54,Paula,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 31, 2020",Best Seaweed Snack I've Tried,"  I just ordered another package of gimMe Organic Roasted Seaweed - Teriyaki --even though I haven't finished enjoying my current order. I love the taste of this seaweed product --I've tried a few different brands and flavors, but I like this one the best. The slight sweetness with a bit of salt and extra flavoring makes it hard to resist. I usually eat two packages when snacking rather than just one. Fortunately, it is very low in calories."
55,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2019",Great tasting product!,"  Great Product!  I get my idodine from this source!

56,Stacie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 4, 2020",Delicious!,"  I use this flavor to make spam masubi wraps and it is the perfect size.  Teriyaki flavor is our families go-to for snacking, but these are great if you don't want the sweet or the little bit of oily texture from that one.  Super crunchy!"
57,Allie C,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2020",Great value and great taste!,"  These are delicious! The picture makes the packs look kind of small, but they're actually pretty large. You get a lot of value especially for the price! If you've never had seaweed before, these feel a bit like paper in your mouth until they start to dissolve. Once you get used to it they're a really delicious snack! And they're definitely better for you than a lot of other tasty snacks."
58,Candace Derr,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2020",So addictive!,  I've tried seaweed snacks before but they were always reminiscent of licking the bottom of an overcrowded & unfiltered fish bowl.. I happened to see these in the store & since they weren't expensive I gave them a try. So glad I did! *Bearing in mind that at this point I've only tried the teriyaki kind* I do wish that there was a version with the same flavor but without the sugar but they taste so good. Hopefully I'll get accustomed to the fishyness & will be able to branch out to other even non-flavored kinds.
59,Chioma,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 26, 2020",Prefer the original,"  I personally prefer the original, this one is less salty. It came in good condition and doesn’t taste bad., but I just prefer it saltier."
60,Randy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2020",Great afternoon snack,  I really like the healthy alternative aspect for a snack that this provides. The flavor is good. The package size is good. The only complaint I have is that my 10 year old doesn't care for it.

64,T.M. Reader,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2020",Slightly weaker on flavor,"  These gimMe seaweed snacks are good.  They are fresh and crisp out of the package (packaged like all the others in the little plastic tray).  The flavor is milder than other brands I've tried . . . less bold and ""fishy"", less salted.  I prefer the bolder flavor.  They are good, but not my favorite."
65,D. Bruce,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2020",I love these!,"  I love these so much I ordered another 20 packages shortly after I got the first.  It really satisfies, in a low carb and low calorie way, my wanting something to munch on during the day when I'm not eating.  I like the flavor and you get a lot of little sheets for 25 calories."
66,J Adame,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 26, 2020",Snack on the Go?,"  I forgot i order them to start eating more healthier snacks on the go; it came on the Friday like it said it would but around 11 am. Over all the packing had no damage, the snacks individual covering was okay also. The freshness was a bit off a little because the Texas heat can do that to forgotten snacks waiting outside your door. Not a lot salt if you are worried about it, but be careful opening the little packet it can get messy at times. It might not be your type of snack if you don't like thin kinda slippery textures in your mouth. No pictures due to I went little crazy planning out my meals for the upcoming days. :)"
67,Ana,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2020",They are delicious and super healthy,"  I love those! They are so addicting but do not worry because they are super healthy! The only thing that kinda bothers me is the packaging, seems a little bit too much plastic. That just made me find ways on how to recycle it and reuse the plastic box that holds them! Bottom line is just ty them out, the teriyaki ones are the best I would say"
68,Bear,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 25, 2019",Crispy and fresh seaweed,  These are a delicious alternative to chips.  I am not a junk food junky so I am thrilled today find seaweed snacks with olive oil.  I think they are very good.  I have bought numerous orders.
69,Otcp99,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2020",New least favorite food.,"  It takes a lot to gross me out, bravo you did it. The flavor has a dirty aquarium taste with a side of fish. What made it worse was it sticks to the roof of your mouth and you can't spit it out. Hope it was a bad batch and others have a better experience with it."
70,k9doc1,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 26, 2020",Not up to Par....!,"  Some packages were missing desiccants, evidence of poor QA/QC.  The quantity of sea lavers in each pack were very little and not too flavorful. In my honest opinion, COSTCO/Kirkland ones are much better quality, flavors, and value for the money."
71,Sanka,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2020","Not the best price, but a delicious product","  Here's the thing... This is just roasted seaweed. It tastes the same as the big packs that are cheaper at a local Oriental grocery store.The packaging is a bit excessive but useful for snacks to take on-the-go.I have heard that organic versions are supposed to contain less heavy metals and other things that can be found in regular seaweed, but I don't see any issue in myself or others that eat non-organic ones as well.Tastes great!"

73,Alfred V. Whiting II,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 14, 2020",Awful taste. Oily.,"  Ordered the 20 pack with a subscription hoping they’d be similar to a brand I regularly purchase at Walmart. The ingredient list is ideal, organic seaweed, oil, and sea salt but they have very little to no flavor. They also seem to have an oil sheen on them and an aftertaste that I’m not used to. I canceled my subscription immediately after trying them and I’ll be contacting amazon to return them if possible ASAP"
74,Matthew,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2020",Taste ok,"  I use this seaweed to roll poke. It tastes ok, and rarely I get any crushed ones. The price is good, but you can find better options for sure"

85,Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2019",To be honest I have never tried seaweed before.,"  With that being said, these things taste like a nasty fish market smells. Maybe all seaweed is like this? Also, I got the sea salt versions and I don't think they had any salt on them whatsoever? Again, maybe they taste how they are supposed to but maaaannn... I just could not go any farther than the first bite. They will be given away or thrown out."

92,Karina,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2020",These are amazing.,  I had been searching for these for quite some time. They are the salty light snack everyone craves around 2:oo p.m. everyday. Sometimes I have a sugar unbalance and need something salty. These are delicious.
93,Jess,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2020",Delish - hint of an aftertaste,  I gave this 4 stars bc I hate the packaging as it’s super wasteful but I’m the one that bought it this way.... This also tastes so good and it has the perfect dash of sea salt taste but there is a very funky aftertaste with this.  It’s subtle but I’m sensitive to things like that.  It wasn’t unbearable but it’s there.  My husband didn’t notice the aftertaste but he also only ate one piece.  I ate the rest of the package.
94,Keith,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 1, 2020",Tasty and Expensive.,"  Compared to say Costco or the Asian Food Markets, this is pretty costly, but it is REALLY tasty.

There's a dessicant packet in each one, so keep an eye on small children with these. Also, mine have been known to cram too much of it in their mouths at once.

98,Megan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2019","Tasty, healthy and addicting!",  I love the umame flavor of roasted seaweed. These preportioned trays are awesome to grab and go. These help take away my cravings for chips. BEWARE they do shed some flakes and arent necessarily simple to pop in your mouth. I fold each sheet twice and then eat it to avoid the sprinkle of  seaweed flakes everywhere.
99,Shoreldy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2019",These are habit forming- great taste!,  I love the teriyaki flavor! These are my favorite seaweed snack.

If you're not used to seaweed, it's crunchy and salty and so addictive.  I have thyroid issues and asked the doctor if i could eat these (because of the iodine content) and he said yes.

521,JWoolman,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2019",Good with nut/seed butter,"  I've tried the GimMe roasted seaweed flavors sea salt, olive oil, sesame oil, and teriyaki and like them all. I had tried another brand years ago and didn't like it, so I was dubious about any ""fishy"" taste even though I know it's fish that taste like algae (which seaweed is) and not really the reverse... Apparently this brand is mild enough for me.I like to eat them with a little bit of nut or seed butter, with the nori sheets rolled up or folded over or covered with another sheet like a sandwich. I usually eat 2 to 4 small sheets at a time. The remainder in the pack stays fresh if I just put the plastic tray in a sandwich bag and seal with a clothes pin. But I have to keep this bag in a rodent-proof container because apparently a little visitor from the crawlspace thought they were delicious... just a plastic bag was not enough protection!"
522,J. Janos,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2020",Great Quality But Poor Quantity & Poor Package Labeling!,"  Purchased this Healthy  Product after looking at Images but 20 Packages Per 10 Flakes versus COSTCO Kirkland 10 Packages Per 50 Flakes. Big difference in Kirkland 500 Seaweed Flakes than GimMe 200 Flakes. Same on Pricing 20 Packages of only 200 Flakes for over $15.00 far more than Kirkland 10 Containers of 500 for $10.00?  provides 50 Flakes per Package providing 500 Flakes for far less money. Additionally, same taste and crunchy as all taste the same to me. Had to Returning the Packages but Amazon was great in accommodating my complaint since I studied the Images and could not reach an Amazon Tech Customer Service due to Virus Limitations before buying GimME. Very disappointed in such overpricing and inaccurate labeling and far less Quantity. The Product is just as good as Kirkland just less for Higher Price. The same goes for Kakoa Friends Brands. They did not provide Flake Number per container unlike COSCTCO providing 50 Flakes per Container on Labels. Once they change Quantity with a Competitive Price they will sell more with less Costs on Packaging. Until then, why 200 when 500 is chaper and of Equal Quality?"
523,Jaimie L. ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 25, 2020",I love Gimme Teriyaki flavor! A review great for those paying close attention to sodium/nutrition,"  Let me start by saying I LOVE Seaweed snacks. If you're someone who has never tried seaweed snacks before, I would start with Gimme brand Teriyaki flavor to introduce you to it!! This product tastes amazing, and doesn't taste overly greasy/oily like other seaweed snack brands sometimes do. This review is specifically for people watching their sodium intake/are on a sodium restriction/are interesting in hearing my perspective on this brand.I am a Registered Dietitian and often pay close attention to what I chose for myself so that I can better make recommendations for friends/family/clients, and I love that one pack (0.17oz) has 30mg of sodium (salt) and is such a nice healthy delicious snack! For anyone who is put on a low salt diet, depending on what your restriction is (again disclaimer, first check with your doctor and RD) you can comfortably have 3 of these 0.17oz packs, and still be eating less than 100mg of salt.  Something to always look for when checking nutrition facts of snacks is whether or not the information you see in the nutrition label is for the whole container, or if it has multiple servings (in which you would want to multiply whatever you see in the label by the number of servings).I have seen other seaweed snack brands have up to 500mg of sodium or more per seaweed pack which is so insane!! Personally, I am very sensitive to salt so other brands with lots of sodium usually cause me to wake up feeling so swollen, but the Gimme Teriyaki flavor is much lower in salt than other brands so I can relax knowing that if I'm craving it I can relax knowing a few packs won't bother me! I love it! Definitely recommend!Note: The other Gimme Seaweed snack flavors, Sesame Flavor and the Sea Salt, have 65mg per the same 0.17oz bags (still not bad). Still not bad, but I probably would not recommend more than about two 0.17 oz packs for the Sesame and Sea Salt flavors for someone on a strict sodium restriction from their doctor. However, just be careful because the larger 0.35oz size bags for both flavors have 130mg for a whole pack (they mention that they have 65mg per serving with 2 servings).Overall, I think that the Gimme Teriyaki flavor is a great choice given that it is only 30mg sodium per pack compared to 65mg salt per pack of the other flavors, and that even for the larger 0.35 oz of the Teriyaki packs they only have 60 mg salt for the whole pack compared to 130mg per 0.35oz pack of the Sesame and Sea Salt flavors."

They have a light, almost but not quite crispy texture. They are just the right amount of salty and sesame-y. The only downside is that they are so expensive for what you get.  On the other hand, as overpriced as they are, $1.50 a package is less than I’d pay at a local supermarket.Update: I've ordered many of these, but my most recent batch was stale.  Very disappointed.  I had given it five stars, but now reduced to four.  Still tasty when fresh...stale ones not edible."

Also, I also ordered a sesame pack too and they are almost expired, the twelve pack just arrived a few days ago and expire in 4 days. Not pleased at all :("

I've tried most of the seaweed snacks on the market and these are by far the best. They have just 3 ingredients; seaweed, sea salt, and sesame oil. They aren't overly oily like some other brands that use canola, rapeseed or olive oil. And they are perfectly salted! Not over and not under. Just amazing, thin, crispy, seaweed deliciousness!

You just eat slices of seaweed by itself? What's wrong with you? It's good, she assured me. Well, I do like sushi, so I hesitantly agreed to try her weird seaweed in a plastic box snack. How can I put into words the feelings that overtook me when my tongue first encountered the papery goodness of these seaweed snacks? How do I describe the exquisite blend of seasonings that tickled my tastebuds into an all out joygasm? These things are like crack and I am an addict. They taste as good as pure, uncut blow. I ate six packets yesterday and ordered more. This is where all my money will go from now on. Rent? Electricity? Who needs that when you can spend your entire pay check on thin slices of seaweed grilled and seasoned to perfection? I hope whoever runs this company enjoys getting filthy rich off me until I hit rock bottom and check into seaweed rehab."
550,Boo Radley 007,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2017",I love these sort of snacks,"  I love these sort of snacks. They are low in calories, fat, and sodium. They have a nice flavor and a delicate (they're thin), not brittle crispness. I've had several cases of them, and have never had problems with broken ones. I used to take them in my lunch and would just throw them in my tote and they remained intact."

These are spicy but not over the top.  These packs ARE very large though so I only take half of a package with me and put the other half in a zip top bag for the next day.They always taste fresh and delicious and I am afraid to try another brand now as I have become so attached to these.

I end up eating a whole bad in one sitting.  Sometimes, luckily not often, even though it's not close to the expiration date, you might end up with one bag where they are stale...but that isn't something that can be foreseen.  Love when I have one batch that is super fresh, and wish all were like that.  I also like the Wasabi ones, but for some reason went back to these, because have noticed that the majority of the batches, are overloaded with wasabi, which doesn't make it as enjoyable to eat anymore.  I would recommend these, but again, never a guarantee that all batches, even when still within the expiration date, are super fresh/regular freshness."

If you're lf wasabi flavor and have a Trader Joe's in your bubble, forego this mistake and acquire the Trader Joe's version.I'm not rating two stars bc they aren't pretty yummy for plain seaweed snacks -- I'm rating two stars bc they are supposed to be wasabi flavored and they aren't."
559,Raymond M,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 15, 2019",Tastes like ocean,"  I LOVE wasabi, but the flavor is so light and soon overtaken by the overwhelming flavor of salty kelp.  They are on the greasy side, and not crisp like a chip.. more like flaky fish food."

I tried reaching out to the company directly with no response.We are an avid consumer of this product I’m talking 2-6 bags a day eaten in my household so I would definitely know!Bottom line this is a great product with great flavor I just don’t understand the hit or miss aspect of it... would love for the company to respond to my concerns and let me know!

562,Lina Farid,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2017",I LOVE seaweed snacks,"  I LOVE seaweed snacks. I have tried several brands and this one is so far my favourite! I have only tried the Wasabi flavour, and I won't be changing that for a while! These are very fresh and flavourful, unlike others where you can barely feel any seasoning. If you like putting wasabi on your sushi then you will surely like the taste of this. It has that slightly spicy/slightly sweet blend, and it's salty too. Whenever I'm craving a snack or something crispy to munch on, these are the healthiest and lowest calories snacks I can think of that satisfy that snack urge and actually fills you up for a while. At first the little singular packet might look small (there's about 20 slices of seaweed in each packet) but it keeps me full for a couple of hours. Highly recommend if you like the taste of sushi!"

It's been hard for me to stop at one pack a day. They're light, crispy, and they have a delightful sesame taste that isn't over powering. I know that some people found them too salty but I haven't had that trouble. As for my GERD?

I did know that i LOVE veggie sushi with tons of wasabi, eating just rice and seaweed, miso soup and wasabi peas so I knew these had to be up my alley. I could not have been more correct! These have some serious wasabi heat, especially if you eat more than one at a time. I think they are a perfect snack. Now if you are looking for something to replace BBQ potatoe chips than you will surely be disappointed. I on the other had find these tastey and addictive.

These are light, flavorful sheets that pack a nice kick with the spicy flavor. These are indeed 'fishy' in taste - hence the SEAweed taste... you know, from the SEA?? But it's not a rancid taste or anything like that. If you don't like the taste of fish, these and other SEAweed products are probably are not for you, but if you enjoy a nice Asian-themed snack, these are PERFECT!! Ordering them on Amazon is definitely a savings over Whole Foods and so far - several orders later - I haven't had any problems with quality, cost or shipment."

600,Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2019","Tastes good, but packages were open.","  The only reason for the low rating is that two of the packages came opened. I had to throw them away, even though they looked untouched. Too bad. The flavor is very good."
601,Christopher Crawford,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2020",Extremely delicious.,"  I wish Annie Chun would change the package design on this product to a flat wrapper with no plastic tray, that is overkill and wasteful for a few tiny pieces of seaweed, I'd rather have more seaweed than plastic. I'd love it if the package size was flat and increased by at least 50% to 100% more content."
602,Neurasthenic,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2011",the gold standard for wasabi seaweed,"  These are identical to the excellent Trader Joe's wasabi seaweed; they clearly come from the same source. They are spicy without being painful, and they dissolve on the tongue. I am totally addicted. Per the sharply divergent reviews on this page, not everybody likes seaweed and even those that do don't necessarily like the spicy variety. Try one before buying a crate of it. However, if you do like the spicy stuff, you won't find any better than this.Also, Amazon's prices are excellent -- a 12-pack that costs $20 from Annie Chun directly costs only $15 here."
603,DB,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2013",Not my cup of tea.,"  I ordered these hoping for a healthy snack alternative to crackers or other junk food.  The biggest killer is that they are the thickness of a Listerine dissolvable breath strip.  I wanted to call it 1-ply TP, but even that has more thickness.  Then there is the mess.  The little flakes of seaweed adhere to you after they've busted off while you try and get the sheet into your mouth.The taste isnt bad, but I feel like I have to stack 3 of them together to get anything out of eating these."

609,Whitaker,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2013",Delicious snack,"  The saltiness and chewiness is enough to satiate your cravings as would another snack, but this is far healthy and only 30 calories per serving.  Wonderfully low-carb ... most of the calories come from the sesame oil it is brushed with.  If I didn't buy this while there was a coupon available I would've thought it was too expensive though. But Amazon's regular price is still a little cheaper per pack than Safeway or my local grocer, who sells them for $1.89 each."

612,Anna,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2013",Delicious and nutritious,"  I absolutely loved these snacks. They certainly taste like like a seafood item and have that ""fishy"" taste to them. If you don't like that kind of flavor or aftertaste, then this is definitely not the product for you. The texture is similar to a Listerine breath strip--which sounds disgusting, but it's actually quite good, as it adds a crunchy, crispy sensation that is kind of like potato chips. They are a little salty, so make sure you have a drink handy when you eat them."

It gets a little limp if you let it sit out.) It tastes salty but doesn't actually have that much sodium. It's full of nutrients. It's reasonably cheap when you buy it in bulk, and even more so if you do a monthly subscription like we do. But it's the subtle sesame flavor--from sesame oil rather than seeds--that makes this seaweed snack stand out among the many other tasty versions out there. Highly recommended."

639,Emily,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2011",Hotter than other brands.  Delicious!,"  I love the taste of seaweed and wasabi, and have an unsatisfiable love for spicy foods.  I have had other brands of wasabi seaweed snacks, and these are by FAR the spiciest.  I saw someone mention that the spice is variable, so it's possible I've eaten extra spicy packs, I suppose, but these have enough kick to ""clear your sinuses"".  If you like your spicy food no hotter than ""medium"" you will probably find these too spicy.  If you love hot foods, you'll probably be pleased that these are hotter than most ""hot"" chips (including potato chips) you've tried.  These are also less greasy than other brands of seaweed snacks.I love them.  Seaweed isn't for anyone as people mentioned.  Sure it tastes fishy.  Do you like the tase of the seaweed in sushi?  If you haven't tried sushi, then this might not be the best intro to seaweed.  If you have had sushi and you particularly like or dislike the seaweed taste there, that should predict pretty well whether you'll like these.  For me, these easily remind me of the taste of sushi with wasabi.I love these and will be buying more."

641,carrieplant,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2012",Go-to snack,"  I ordered some of these Annie Chun's Seaweed Snacks after watching a friend much on roasted seaweed.  After searching on amazon, I chose these and two flavors from Sea's Gift.  I chose the Roasted Sesame flavor over the other flavors because the ingredients are simpler.  Each package has small (but not tiny) rectangles of seaweed lined up on a tray.  I fold the pieces in half and stuff them in my mouth.  I find that if I bite the seaweed, I get more ""crumbs.""  Either way, I still wind up with pieces of seaweed on my shirt and have to check myself in the mirror after eating (also pieces get stuck in my teeth like spinach, so I have learned to check that, too). I like the texture of this seaweed-paper thin, light, and crisp.  I like the flavor-mild.  I prefer this brand to Sea's Gift because of the milder flavor.  They seem fresh.  I did not detect any off-tastes or rancidity.  I appreciate the high vitamin content and the low calories.  I reach for these when I want something crunchy.  I eat them as a snack in between meals to keep me from eating crackers. I also eat them along side a meal instead of crackers."

They are actually pretty tasty, and a great snack!!! Try more than one sheet before you decide! I definitely wouldn't call these hot; somewhere between medium and mild would be more accurate. 1 package = 2 servings = 60 calories. It's hard to beat those numbers!"
692,Laurie J.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2013",Great new seaweed,"  I tried seaweed years ago by boiling it in broth but couldn't stand the fishy taste. After being diagnosed with low thyroid function, it's important that I get enough iodine in my diet. What an improvement over those big hard sheets of kombu. These don't have a fishy taste at all. I eat 3 sesame and 2 wasabi (quite hot alone) each day. Delicious!"

694,Lisa,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2013",Best snack ever!,"  I must admit I did not like these AT ALL when I forced myself to eat the first pack.  I didn't know what I would do with the other 11 packages, so they sat on the kitchen counter for a couple of weeks.  I think I was expecting the taste of the seaweed my mom used to buy when I was a kid...no salt or any kind of seasoning on it and this had too much ""bite"" for me.  I finally decided to try them one more time, took a few bites and low and behold...delicious!  My teenager loves them also so we are making sure to keep a good supply on hand so we can snack on these in the evening instead of reaching for unhealthy chips.  I actually haven't bought a bag of chips since buying these and we used to go through a couple of big bags of chips and dip a week. They are salty (which is what I crave) but not overly so.  Crispy and savory...and healthy too! Can't beat it!UPDATE: NOVEMBER12, 2013I have ordered several more times and we still love these.  I actually crave them now!  Give them a chance, even if you aren't crazy about them at first (I thought they were horrible) they may grow on you like they did me!  :>)"

I even avoid using fish sauce as an ingredient when Asian recipes call for it bc it grosses me out.  Yet this I like. It's stinky at first, yes, LOL, but in a weirdly good way I suppose.  I am dieting for some months now and finding anything to snack on without racking up the calories is hard work, so when I do snack, I need guilt-free and low-caloric snacks.  I eat 10 or so at a time but it's hard to stop and I want them to last.  Now with this package of 12, I am golden.  I tried the other varieties of this brand, but didn't like it at all. It is obviously the 'hot kick"" that this one gives that makes it more interesting to me. It comes well packed and the 'best before' date is April of 2014, almost six months from now. They won't last that long :)"

It's also free of soy sauce, which usually contains wheat, so it suits my gluten free diet.  I drink soy milk and take a supplement with soy isoflavones which tend to bind iodine, so the super boost of iodine in the seaweed is a great benefit for me.The seaweed sheets are crisp and we eat them like potato chips or sometimes we wrap them around warm rice. Make sure you have a napkin. The healthy oils on this seaweed can be a little messy on the hands.My kids love this stuff. - They were introduced to seaweed at a young age.

719,Vivi,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 8, 2015",Bleh! Ew! Stay away!,"  Greasy and tastes like cheap oil. The oil covers up the taste of the laver and doesn't taste anything like either roasted laver nor sesame. It tastes like what I imagine frying oil that's been sitting for a month at a fast food joint might taste like -though that might even prove more flavorful than this.I don't like wasting food but after trying to stomach my way through two packs of these over the course of a month, I threw the rest out. It tastes about as delectable as a wet napkin. D:I'd recommend Jayone Seaweed instead for the real roasted laver taste."

726,Daniel Goldman,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 24, 2013",A good snack item.,"  Seaweed snacks aren't so common in America yet, but you find them a lot in Asian grocery stores. What are they like? Well, they're crispy and salty snacks, that pretty much melt away as you eat them, a good match for beer, I'd say. They aren't very filling though, so don't plan on making a meal out of them. Annie Chun's version of this snack is the one I usually get. The roasted sesame flavor is something agreeable to most American palettes, although their wasabi flavored snacks are also good.A note about storage: Once you open these, you want to make sure they're consumed pretty quickly or stored in a dry place. They don't stay crisp long once open, especially if it's humid."

Each bite starts out crispy, with just the right amount of salt and sesame flavor, and then turns chewy (but not the kind of chewy thicker seaweed can be where it seems to expand in your mouth as you chew it).  I can eat an entire package without feeling remorse; the caloric and sodium levels are not high.  This is a healthful alternative to eating potato chips and seems to satisfy me just as much.  My supervisor likes these with smoked salmon spread. Sounds good, but I have not tried it yet. I have a coworker who does not like seaweed.  I convinced her to try these, because they are so light and yummy (to me), but these were no exception for her.  She sounded like a cat trying to clear a hairball.

Then we found similar snacks at one of the local Asian Grocery stores. They had products from several manufacturers, so we tried a bunch. They ALL basically tasted the same, so we now just buy the ones that are on sale. They are under $4.00 for 8 pack and 10 pack units (depending on the brand). THIS IS MUCH CHEAPER THAN THE PRICE OF THESE ON AMAZON. Since we eat these all the time, this is much more economical for us. My wife hates the ""fresh"" taste of fish, but she loves these, so I am surprised that people found them too ""fishy""."
796,sarah fick,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2011",The Perfect Snack for us,"  I have to admit, before I opened up the Seaweed Snacks, I was expecting a thicker snack because of the picture on the box. When I saw the actual product...I thought...* Wow!...They are sooo thin!.. *Will they have flavor?..*Would they be filling?...  *Will we munch half the boxes up in one sitting trying to feel like we ate something?, and *Did I waste my money?*... Our answer: Definitely NOT wasted money! To our suprise, yesterday, my husband and I shared one .35 oz. pkg, which, with a drink, and found that not only was our serving of the ""wafers"" filling enough to take our hunger away until dinner, but was also very tasty!...(Actually, it was so tasty that today, I ate a whole pkg myself!... They're sooo addicting!!!). The seaweed flavor is strong enough for its taste to come through, but yet, subtle enough to not overwhelm the tastebuds...Yummy!! My husband and I liked the snack so much, I told two of our neighbors about them and let them try some. They also liked them alot, so I gave them each a pkg. to take with them. We even broke the snack into little pieces and let my neighbors' 6 mos. baby suck on them until soft, (when put in the mouth, the hard *wafer* texture  almost immediately  dissolves into the texture of cooked spinach). Once softened she ate about 3 wafers right down!  (If you do let your young child try it..I would strongly recommend an adult breaking, holding, and feeding the small wafer pieces on his/her fingers for the child.) My neighbor said to her husband, *She, (the baby), loves them, too...We have to buy some!*I'm  glad I've found this snack, as being Seaweed, it has soo many more nutritional benefits,(necessary vitamins and minerals, and being low in fat), that I believe it is a great alternative to many of the other snacks that are being sold. It does, however, have a little more salt on it than I would like...(health wise).  It would be nice if they came out with a low,(or at least a lower salt), seaweed snack package...but even if they dont..I will continue to buy these due to their delicious flavor!Anyway, to summarize it all we decided that  [[ASIN:B003NUYBV8 Annie Chun's Seaweed Snacks, Roasted Sesame, 0.35-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)] will be the Perfect Snack for us and would definitely recommend them!

However, my husband, who can eat salmon, couldn't keep it down, either. I plan on giving the rest of it to my niece who loves sushi. I'm sure she'll like this.

My biggest complaint is that they're difficult to eat without making a huge mess.  Imagine incredibly thin squares (like tissue paper but even 1/4 as thick) that flakes apart and is somewhat greasy on your hands. There are like 30 in each individual package because they're such thin sheets of paper.  I thought they would be more chip like but they're super messy to eat and leave flakes of greasy seaweed everywhere.  Won't be buying again although the flavor was good

The WASABI ones are spicy in a way that they burn once you put them in your mouth but there is no after burn so it's kind of cool! As a note I recommend eating the whole pack once it's open because they will become soft and not crunchy after a while. Having said that eating a pack is not a problem... they are light and yummy!

BUT of all the seaweed snacks I've tried, and I've tried half a dozen at my local health food store, THIS is the one I decided to buy in bulk as a subscription on Amazon (FYI: I spend a fortune at that local health food store, so don't feel too sorry for it, and I have to strike a balance on spending somewhere!).  What makes this snack better than the others?  Three things: 1) the seaweed is in small sheets and is much thinner -- you don't get a big thick layer of it, 2) it has a great distracting hot & salty taste (salt & wasabi) that gives it a refreshing zing, and 3) it has nice crispiness.

Yes, that sounds like a ""Duh"" statement, but they really are sort of fishy. Crispy texture, and a nice little wasabi kick, but don't let them sit on your tongue too long or they sort of melt and taste very seaweedy. My husband spit out his one and only taste, but I thought they were pretty good. On the other hand, a co-worker actually gagged and wiped her tongue after one bite. Very crunchy and thin, but a little bit goes a long way for me. I don't think I'll order them again simply because I'd eat them occasionally but not as my first choice for a snack. I do like the wasabi tingle, but I'll stick to wasabi peas."

I decided to order these and I find them to be less salty and less fishy than the brand I've bought at the market.  These snacks are also not over spicy.  The pricing is also very good."

My first impression of these seaweed snacks was ""salted cellophane,"" but then I gave it a moment, tried another, and another.They're very mild in taste. Like paper thin greens kissed with salt, that start out crunchy and completely soften in your mouth. I tried a single pack bought elsewhere and liked it enough to come back here for the case. They're tasty, but messy. If they were a a little narrower, you could more easily fit a whole one in your mouth and eat neatly. And they tend to disintegrate and stick to your teeth so I wouldn't eat these at work, but at home with dinner, or as a snack, sure, no problem.Snackable vegetables, seriously. While they're not particularly filling, they're kind of fun to eat and are supposed to be pretty good for you. High in vit. A and 30 calories for half a package. (20 calories fat of the 30, from the oil)I ate these 3-4 sheets at a time and stored the open package in the fridge. They stayed crunchy until I finished the package, which took me about 3 days."

However I just want to be clear that these are very thin, like paper thin. They have very few carbs but it is a strange snack. I realize I don't eat a lot of seaweed/kelp, but there are different sorts of seaweed/kelp, and some much thicker than this. You can't use these as chips or with dip, so don't try to replace potato chips with them. They are just thin little salty pieces of paper.

The ONLY reason I don't give it 5 stars is that I'm ordering a box at a time (12 packages) and the bottom of the box is spotted in oil that has leaked out of the bags (I'm guessing). This has happened on every box I've ordered - it makes me wonder. Anyway, the oil is also on the outside of the bags, etc. so be careful when handling. I love the taste though and this small issue won't keep me from ordering them!"

I guess I'll just keep buying the overpriced ones from the local grocery store."
1123,E. Williams,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2011",An acquired taste - just not to our tastes,"  These seaweed snacks are prepared well and packaging is great. You just have to LIKE seaweed and wasabi in a paper-thin crispy/flakey form. Sounded good, but it's an acquired taste, and we've decided after trying them that perhaps the folks at work would like them better.  We left the case in the break room.  So far, no takers."

1130,Mo'ui,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2012",Inconsistent Taste,"  I first tasted Annie Chun's seaweed three years ago while in California. It was delicious, especially the Wasabi, so I purchased about ten packs. After returning home, I found it could be ordered from Amazon at a very reasonable price and have purchased them regularly ever since. NO MORE! The last shipment contained a few packages that did not smell right. The pieces of seaweed had a dull, grey coating on them. They tasted terrible. I blew it off the first couple of times and went ahead with another shipment. Last night I opened a container that smelled of burning plastic. The pieces were once again dull and appeared to have a grey coating on them. The coating, unfortunately, was not wasabi. It is strange that not all of the packages have the smell or coating on them, but now I am uncomfortable eating the product. I trusted Annie Chun's product but have decided to stop purchasing it, going with my intuition that there is a problem at the source they are not addressing."

1137,NONE,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2012",Greasy & salty & unflling,"  I ordered these because I thought they'd be a great snack when kayaking. A lot of bulky packaging. I had no idea what to expect. These are oily to the touch, bland and salty. (Yes, I know seaweed is salty) but the flavor was just oily salt. I'm not a potato chip person, so maybe if you're a chip-person, these may appeal to you a bit more. I had to use a lot of hand sanitizer to degrease my hands afterwards. (Don't carry napkins in yak) I'll be eating them elsewhere with some chipolte powder.Interestingly, no fiber in these, so it wasn't filling at all. Kinda pointless. Not a lot of calories, but not enough nutritional bang.And a warning - plan on brushing your teeth afterwards - had pieces stuck in my teeth the rest of the day."
1138,Tree,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2015",Mmmm.  Fishy paper slime!,"  I found these to be completely disappointing.  I was looking for a healthy, low-carb snack with crunch.  The description/reviews seemed to imply that's what these were.  I was thinking they'd be like kale chips, and I've also had seaweed based snacks that I enjoyed in the past, so I rolled the dice.  I'm a pretty adventurous eater, so why not?  When the box arrived (unfortunately, I'm stuck with 12 packages of these now), I opened the first package and reached in-- what I pulled out was as thin as the thinnest paper (translucent, in fact), and flexible-- when bent in half, they tear a little but do not 'snap.'  There went my hopes of a satisfying crunch.  Still, I ate one.  It tasted like fish, not sesame, and the texture became slimy as I chewed.  In fact, they get nice and wedged into the crevasses of your molars like toffee, so you get to enjoy that fishy taste for a while!  I ate one more ""crisp"" just to be sure I hadn't gotten a bad one... and... yep.  I can't face a third one, even for science.  These were not enjoyable and I suspect I will be hard-pressed to find them a good home."

Subtle but satisfying saltiness, hint of lovely sesame, ahh. Heaven. I take a package of these to work with me to snack on. So good!"
1142,Lisa Kearns,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2012","Delicious, crispy - an unusual snack","  These seaweed snacks were an impulse item, and I'm so glad we tried them.  There are 12 individually sealed packages in the box, and each package has about 20 super-thin seaweed snacks.  They're almost thin enough to read through, and the whole container only has 2 carbs, making them perfect for low-carb dieters.  They're surprisingly filling, and not overly salty.  They are extremely crispy and the entire package should be eaten soon after opening.  Humidity will make them gummy in just a short time.The nutrition information from Annie Chun's website says that each package of this sesame flavor has: 60 calories, 2 grams protein, 140 mg sodium, 5 grams of fat, 70% of daily vitamin A, 12% of daily vitamin C, and minerals (unnamed on the ingredients list).I like that these are all-natural and don't contain preservatives or food coloring.  I like that it's a novel way to eat vegetables, and that my kids love them. Next we'll try the wasabi flavor.My only complaint about this product is that they use canola oil in them.  Canola oil is in so many foods we eat, and the process used to make it (hexane - a petroleum product, and high heat) causes it to produce free radicals in our body.  Free radicals are linked to obesity, heart disease and degenerative diseases in our bodies.  I would much prefer that all foods be made with cold-pressed oils like olive, peanut or sunflower oil.But canola oil aside, these seaweed snacks are delicious, filling, low carb, and we'll be buying them again."
1143,SP,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2013",Not bad but I can live without it,"  At first I really enjoyed this but after eating more of it I grew to find it less satisfying and a bit too ""fishy."" I prefer dulse I guess. You also don't get much for the price. It would be better if it was denser. Easy to eat a whole bag to yourself. Not resealable, so if you don't finish it then I would recommend putting it into a ziploc bag so it doesn't go stale."

I rolled a small amount of sticky rice into the seaweed sheets, it was good. I also tried cream cheese and a sour cream mix, it made for a very good snack. Seaweed is healthy for you, but not for everyones taste. Next time I make Undon noodles, will add the seaweed snacks to the bowl."

I was so excited to see it here. BUT IT'S NOT! And I'm hopping this review might motivate them to clarify the description. This is just seaweed in little sheets. Tastes okay, though.

They also are good in sandwiches and on salads.  I've also put them in bagels with cream cheese.  Only complaint is on the packaging.  I probably will sort of reduce my purchasing... I think I can replicate the flavors with nori seaweed sheets, sea salt and wasabi powder.  Will also be doing the environment a favor."

If you want a noticeable salt flavor, choose this snack.  Sea's Gift tastes bland in comparison.  I feel like the sheets in this snack are also a bit crispier than the Sea's Gift variety.I also prefer the larger packs the Annie Chun's variety come in compared to the Sea's Gift as I inevitably end up eating 2 of the Sea's Gift to feel satisfied with the size of my snack.Pros vs. Sea's Gift:* More salt!* Crispier/Crunchier* More per packCons vs. Sea's Gift:* ...none"

1214,Kyra M. Woods,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 24, 2010",Wasabi!,"  These wasabi flavored roasted seaweeds are okay. I love roasted seaweed; Its my favorite snack. Normally I eat the sesame or teriyaki flavored. However, because this was fairly cheap for the amount, I bought the wasabi flavored. Wasabi is a moderate (for some mild) spicy tasting spice from the wasabi plant. The spicyness was not the problem; it just....tastes okay. Its a little strong, and its actually more spicy for the nose than the mouth (if you inhale it, it's not a pleasant feeling, but I don't know why anyone would just sniff it). Anyway, i love roasted seaweed, but wasabi is just okay."

My last order in March was a 12 pack for $8 and change-they are now over $16 for the exact same product in the exact same flavor, size, and packaging.  As quickly as these delicious snacks disappear in my house these are now cost prohibitive for our family.  These suckers are now $3.85 per OUNCE!  I took away two stars because of this HUGE price jump.  I will adjust if the cost goes back down to a reasonable amount.Ridiculously delicious and addictive snacks-I highly suggest buying multiple cases at a time or you will be ordering them a couple times a week.

The crunchy lightweight sheets of seaweed come organized in a clear plastic tray like file folders in a cabinet. This is unlike other brands I've tried where the sheets come stacked like a pile of papers. Is there some kind of advantage to this? I'm not sure, but it adds to product distinction. This snack doesn't exactly fill you up. I went through my first 3 packs in under 5 minutes. It's simply not designed to be a main dish. Instead, use it on occasion for whenever you feel the need to have your taste buds wracked by some awesome umami flavor!"

1298,Justin Lee,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 12, 2013","Good taste, wasteful packaging","  These seaweed snacks are thin (relative to other seaweed sheets) and have a nice crisp texture. The Wasabi seasoning is pretty light, and you don't get much horseradish spiciness, nevertheless the taste is quite good. The only complaint I have about these is that there is a LOT of packaging relative to the snack. Each .35oz of product has a bag, plastic tray, and anti-moisture package, it would be nice if there were a bulk order option that was several oz of sheets in a single plastic wrap, like you would see for seaweed sheets used for sushi."

I was really excited to try these after reading some of the reviews.  I like unique flavors, seaweed and wasabi included.  These see through, tissue paper thin wisps are perhaps the worst thing I have ever eaten.  Granted I've never tried water used to clean fish guts which has been sitting out in the hot sun for three days but I imagine if I were to drink this water, it would taste like these snacks.  At best, there is a hint of wasabi which is so short lived there is no way to mask the awful taste.  Find something else to snack on, anything, you'll be very glad you did.Now I just have to find some kind of craft project to do with ALL these little tiny sheets of seaweed I've purchased.

So not. These taste awful. They tasted like fish and not in a good way. I think this must be what the bottom of a river tastes like.

1384,Anon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2019","Best tasting, light crispy and clean. Not overly seaweed tasting with a nasty filmy aftertaste.","  I've eaten a lot of seaweed snacks over the decades and Annie Chun's are by far my favorite in taste and texture. Sea Salt and Sesame flavor are fantastic, Wasabi ... not so much, way too strong on the wasabi. Oddly enough, many seaweed snacks can be overly seaweed tasting, maybe too heavy, pressed or cut too thick and often too oily. Trader Joe's has their version in large packs for a dollar, but I rarely finish a single pack as they are just too heavy and don't leave me wanting anymore, I've tried on several occasions. Nasty seaweed snacks often leave a filmy aftertaste in your mouth and the seasonings just don't taste balanced or right, especially as more longterm snack. And that's what I like about Annie Chun's, these snack are pressed thin, have a light crispy chew that breaks down easily, and don't leave your mouth with a gross lingering overwhelming aftertaste from bad seasoning or too much oil. The larger 0.35 oz packs are certainly the way to go compared to those tiny 0.16 oz which I can devour in under a few minutes. Found the larger cases on sale at my local Asian grocer and bought them out, I can easily eat three or more packages of the Sesame or Sea Salt a day without getting burnt out on the flavor and texture. Finding these for a dollar or less is a pretty good deal as average individual packing pricing on most other brands is around $1 for the 0.16 oz. and $2 and up for the 0.35 oz. Hoping I can keep Annie Chun's seaweed snacks stocked in the home all the time."

Noting ingredients sunflower and sesame oils (not canola!) and ""Best Before"" date a reasonable 5 months hence on ""4.28.2017"" took one home and just now had some with Nishiki sushi style rice. As a nori lover for at least 60 years I can say that taste and texture were as good as it gets, not ""fishy"" as reported by others. Took off a star because IMO it was a bit too messy oily compared to others I have enjoyed.As a side note, I would be more confident purchasing food products from Amazon if shelf life expiration dates are posted. And, with sufficient negative customer reviews a product should be checked for quality. That said, I have and will continue to purchase items not available in local grocery outlets and so far practically all been satisfactory."
1386,Sneaky Burrito,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 18, 2014",low-calorie and should appeal to people who like the taste of sesame,"  I recently had a chance to try these.  They're not my favorite thing ever, but they do have some good qualities.  First of all, a serving is only 30 calories.  Granted, they're quite thin and not very substantial.  But enough effort is involved in eating them that you at least feel like you've gone through the motions of eating a snack, and often, for me, that's enough to get rid of my mid-afternoon hunger/boredom.Taste-wise, these remind me of many other kinds of seaweed (nori that I've had with vegetarian California rolls, kombu pieces that end up in my beans, etc.).  I can really taste the sesame oil, as well.  And these are fairly salty, although one serving only has 70 mg of sodium (3% of what you should get daily).  I do not understand why so many of the negative reviewers thought these tasted like fish.  There's no fish in them -- they're vegan!  They're also quite high in vitamin A.These are not going to appeal to everyone.  If you are fond of Asian food, especially Japanese or Korean food, you will probably be a fan of these.  These do leave a bit of oil on your fingertips, by the way.They seem to be pretty shelf-stable.  I left a completely open package on my desk overnight and they tasted the same the first day (and have the same texture) as they did the second day."
1387,AndsterManNYC,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2011",Very good if you love wasabi flavor/bite and seaweed snacks in general,"  Only get these if you like the taste of wasabi. Although it's a bit more subtle then the wasabi that's dabbed on your sushi, you still definitely get the wasabi bite (they seem to be along the same line of the extra spicy wasabi covered peas, maybe a little bit saltier).  With subscribe and save, these packs come out to $1/pack which is quite a bit cheaper than what you spend outside Amazon (Whole Foods, Trader Joe's or supermarket) for this type of snack.  You do get quite a few sheets in each pack (20) and each one is seasoned with the perfect amount of spicy/hot wasabi and salt.  They are also nice and crunchy since they are packaged separately, and they do not seem as greasy as some other brands I've tried from the Asian markets. Although they are not greasy, one package (which contains two 10-sheet servings) has a total of 4 grams of fat (which is a little above my 3 gram target for low fat foods and unfortunately I cannot eat only half a pack.  They seem to lose their crunchiness once they're opened...that's my excuse for eating the entire pack and I'm sticking to it)."

1390,Chad,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2016",Good healthy snack if you like the texture of seaweed.,"  I tried these before when I saw them at Target and I had to buy more. They are a great snack when you crave something to eat, but are not that hungry. They are low in calories and rather healthy for a snack and if you are dieting eating a few of these is better than going for a full meal. I tried some Costco brand salt seaweed snacks although the Costco seaweed snacks have more in one package they do seem cheaper if that is possible for seaweed snacks and Annie Chun's were more flavorful. The wasabi flavoring is not too strong, but there is a noticeable kick to them. If you are a spicy food fanatic like me you might not notice the spice as much, but when I shared some others though they did think there was some kick to them. The price is about standard from Amazon as the seaweed snacks I got from Costco were similarly priced."
1391,Seek Felicity,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2012",I really like these; they've inspired me to make my own,"  I'd been curious about seaweed snacks for quite some time.  After trying a pack of Annie Chun's Seaweed Snacks, I have to say I am a fan.  The snacks are perfect as just that -- a snack.  They have 60 calories per container so you don't have to feel bad about eating one or two containers.The seaweed is thin but has a crispy component.  There is a bit of salt but I wouldn't say that these are anywhere near as salty as a Lay's potato chip.  Initially, the smell of the seaweed seemed very strong.  I don't eat fish but that was all I could think of when eating the first few pieces.  After a while, I didn't notice the scent so much.There are two things that I don't like about this product.  The first is the amount of packaging.  The second is the use of canola oil.  To deal with both, I've started to make my own snacks.  I use nori and apply coconut oil or sesame oil and salt and place it in the oven for a bit.  For those that think these are too salty, the make your own method allows you to control the amount of oil and salt.Made in Korea.If interested in trying a single package of Annie Chun's and your grocery store does not carry the product, try iherb.com.

One day I happened to find these in the mini-mart and bought them to see if they were better/worse than what I had been getting previously.As far as taste goes, these are the same thing as the TaoKaeNoi product, but the individual chips (sheets?) are thinner and more delicately packaged.  I like both products for the most part, but I think I like the texture of the thicker chips better.Now for the price.  This product is ounce-for-ounce twice as expensive as the product from the asian market.  A 1.27 oz bag of TaoKaeNoi is only $2 whereas this product is $3.64/oz according to the information at the top of the page.

And if you don't like wonderfully tasty, crispy (and healthy!) snacks, they might not be your thing either!But I'm guessing you already passed these by if you fall into the former category, and I'm guessing not many people fit into the latter.My only complaint with these is that the wasabi coating seems to be slightly variable on them, as in I'll have one piece that's moderately hot, and then another that's really not at all. These are horribly addictive too, so it's not like I can just eat a couple of them anyways! They're fairly healthy, which makes me not feel as bad about sucking down a whole pack, but my wallet is more of a limiting factor than my appetite on buying these damn things!In short, these are tasty but moderately spicy. If you like wasabi, you'll love them. If you like seaweed (in whatever form; seaweed salad, on/around your sushi, etc), you'll love them. If you think you hate seaweed since it sounds icky, I bet you'll still love them!"

It's really addictive though. Individually packed vertically in a container, which helps with the leftover seaweed. Every container has about 20 sheets, which is very generous. Seaweed is not as crunchy and heavy as the Tao brand, which has less wasabi flavor on each sheet and the flavor is not as evenly distributed. Be careful not eat too much because the wasabi flavor is quite strong and the flavor can cause the same sensation as too much wasabi on a sushi."

NOT! People need to be educated about this non-food that truly can do you harm over time.also there is modified corn starch, also if not organic than most likely GMO based - Genetically Modified Organism - as is 90% of all corn and soy derived food stuffs in this country -unless stated as organic, youre likely on the losing end. And one more ingredient - maltodextrin -if you are gluten intolerant or sensitive or just want to cut gluten out of your diet, then you don't want this grain derived sweetener.

1404,ChibiNeko,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 21, 2011","Good, but not something I'll buy again","  I've pretty much loved most of the Annie Chun line so I figured that I'd give the seaweed snacks a try. I figured that they would make for a nutritious & low calorie snack.The Good: The treats are very filling & while the serving size is about 10 pieces, you'll really only need a few in order to feel full. (I chalk that up to the sheer amount of nutrients there's supposed to be in seaweed.)The Bad: This stuff is so salty that you'll really only want to eat a few of these at a time. There's a little hint of a fishy flavor, but it's not strong enough to put me off of eating them.Overall these are decent enough to where I'll finish the rest of the bag, but I'm not thrilled enough with this to where I see myself buying more. This is sort of a ""you like it or you don't"" type of snack. I purchased the wasabi flavor as well, so perhaps I'll have better luck with those instead."

1407,Susan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2014",Make you own!,"  These are delicious, truly, and I can't begrudge the money I've spent on them because they made me realize how tasty and healthy seaweed can be.  These days, though, I find it much healthier, more economical and friendlier on the environment to just buy nori sheets and make them myself.  Brush nori sheets (the kind you make sushi with) with toasted sesame oil, spinkle a tiny amount of salt and then toast on a baking sheet in an oven at 225 degrees for about ten minutes until crispy.  Eeeeeeeasy, cheap, you control the ingredients and less packaging wastage.  I don't know how well these would store, mainly because I always gobble them down too quickly.  Low carb, calorie, and very tasty."

No worries about little crumbs everywhere.  We get uniform, rectangular pieces.  They are lightly flavored, a little salty, but oh-so-good."

Then we found similar snacks at one of the local Asian Grocery stores. They had products from several manufacturers, so we tried a bunch. They ALL basically tasted the same, so we now just buy the ones that are on sale. They are under $4.00 for 8 pack and 10 pack units (depending on the brand). THIS IS MUCH CHEAPER THAN THE PRICE OF THESE ON AMAZON. Since we eat these all the time, this is much more economical for us. My wife hates the ""fresh"" taste of fish, but she loves these, so I am surprised that people found them too ""fishy""."

These are delicious and full of flavor.  They are very light and only 30 calories for 1 serving (half the package).  If you happen to take a breath when putting one in your mouth, watch out because you will get a wasabi attack in your nostrils.  If you've ever had a little too much wasabi on your sushi, you'll know what I mean.  These are so tasty and the only bad thing about them is that when I eat them, I crave sushi.  These are very appetizing and I would recommend that you buy a single package first if you've never tried them.  If you've had nori snacks before and like the kick that wasabi gives you, you won't be dissapointed in these.  These are amazing."

In my opinion, these are even better than Trader Joes!  They are a bit salty, but that is part of what I love about them.  I am so happy to have found a salty snack that I can feel good about eating, rather than guilty.  Even my three year old devours them!

The package said that the seaweed was roasted with sesame oil but the ingredients listed as follow: seaweed, canola oil, sesame oil, and salt.  Well, canola oil is healthy as well.

Love the Sesame due to the saltier flavor. I acknowledge I may be odd for that but I've always been a salt fan and these are so much better than chips!

Came to Amazon looking for a bulk buy. ;o)I didn't really know what to expect. These are very light and flaky--I wouldn't say crispy, exactly. They disintegrate as soon as they hit the moisture in your mouth, much like cotton candy does. They have a nice wasabi flavor, strong, but not so hot that it would prevent you from just downing the whole package at once. (Well, not for me anyway. But I am a bit of a wasabi addict.)That said, they are so ephemeral as to be unsatisfying. A better idea might be to wrap these around sushi rice for impromptu maki."

At 60 calories a package, I can eat the whole thing (or even 2 or 3 of them) and not have blown my diet. When a friend told me about them, I thought, ""I'm not sure if I like seaweed"", but I tried them just so I could say I tried them.  They are so good.  The sesame oil really gives them a good flavor and they satisfy my salt cravings.  My husband loves them too. I can't believe he grabs them for a snack now too.  We're both eating healthier thanks to these snacks.You can find them at the health food stores in the Asian section (Walmart might even have them - I haven't looked in their Asian section).  That way you can try them before ordering a case.I like them so much that I have them ordered on automatic shipment now.  I tried other brands, but Annie Chun's is the best one by far."

This snack does not remind me of fish at all.  I have not noticed any type of offensive smells and I am normally disgusted and lose my appetite around fishy smells.The best part is that these snacks are actually nutritious.  I like that we're getting a 1/3 of Vit A daily needs from them. It's really not that much salt (3% of DV) vs. a lot of processed foods that have much more salt per serving."

Well once you get past the slight amount of heat from the wasabi (sorry I eat habeneros so yes slight heat) it tasted like burnt rubber.  I brought the box into work from there and it sat for a couple months (within which time a couple people opened and tried 2 of the packages)  After that it made its way to the trash can as nobody wanted to eat it.I really am surprised by some of the reviews on here saying its delicious though...  Maybe I just got a bad pack, or maybe its a case of the shill...

The only issue is that they do taste a tiny bit more fishy or ocean like.

Maybe I just like salt, but compared to other seaweed/nori snacks I've had, these are particularly light and not salted enough for me.  That aside, I do like that they come in little wrapped cases to keep me from eating too many in one go.  But at the same time it seems a bit wasteful packaging-wise.  When I opened the individual package, the smell seemed a bit heavy and ""off"" compared to other seaweed snacks, but I figure seaweed can sometimes be like that and you just have to work around it knowing that it tastes better than it smells.  Also, due to the sesame oil, the inside of the packaging is a bit oily, which in turn gets your fingers a bit oily.  Overall, not bad as seaweed snacks go, but not great."

Most of them I get from the Japanese market, which also remain hit and miss.  This particular brand makes the seaweed snacks too potently flavored with wasabi.  The coating is uneven among several packages I've consumed.  In general, the wasabi dusting overpowers the seaweed and you lose track of the main product.Considering taste as well as value, I rank these are poor if you have local means to pick up some seaweed snacks.  If you aren't near an Asian market, these will do but I might try to find a non-wasabi version.  These are overpowering as well as a tad too salty for my taste."

NOT! People need to be educated about this non-food that truly can do you harm over time.also there is modified corn starch, also if not organic than most likely GMO based - Genetically Modified Organism - as is 90% of all corn and soy derived food stuffs in this country -unless stated as organic, youre likely on the losing end. And one more ingredient - maltodextrin -if you are gluten intolerant or sensitive or just want to cut gluten out of your diet, then you don't want this grain derived sweetener.

It has been approximately 20 minutes since ""the bite"" and despite a bowl of apple cinnamon oatmeal and two cups of coffee and water I cannot erase the fish from the memory of my taste buds.

After my eyes cleared and I had wiped away the tears, I read the package to see if there was some kind of warning label...""Warning: only for the insane!""  I can't eat them straight out of the package, it's too intense for me.  I've had to find other creative uses for them...adding to soups or pasta dishes or on top of a salad.  I purchased these with the intention of eating them as a snack replacement for potato chips.  Sadly, not an option with this flavor, so I won't be purchasing these again.

I picked them up at Whole Foods, because if I hated them, I would not be stuck with 14 bags. Anway, these things are just large seaweed sheets cut up in bit size and so spicy, you can't eat them. I expected them in a chunky chip, because the magazine touted them as a very filling snack. You could never get filled up with these thin things and the spice and salt are just too much. If you want something like this, just cut up the large sushi sheet seaweed and season; much cheaper."

How can that be?  A portions size is 5 grams and there are 36 portions in a bag so to figure out what a portion is you can either get a scale and weigh them to figure out how many are in 5 grams or  dump out the bag and make 36 piles and then count how many are in a pile This is deliberately deceiving because they don't want us to know what a portion size is.

I'm very health conscious and don't eat ""snack foods"" too often. But when I tried these wheat free, gluten free darlings... Yay! My favorite flavors are Fiesta Lime (which I served with homemade organic, grassfed chili) and the Sesame&Seaweed. But I've tried the Santa Fe BBQ as well and they are great. You won't be disappointed.*NOTE on price- These chips are around $2.69/bag but have steadily creeped up in price to well over $3 and change. Shop around. You shouldn't be paying more than $2 and change per bag or you're getting ripped off. And don't forget that many of these sites tack on shipping charges so you'll REALLY be paying too much. I like Vitacost. I've purchased products from them several times and they usually offer free shipping and many good deals. My things always arrive quickly too. Try them.Enjoy your new favorite snack! :)  Be well."

1598,"Have Fun, Because It's Too Short!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2016","I do NOT like healthy, but these are good!","  I am not a nutritionist, so not going to give you my view on the nutrition of the bars. See the ingredients photo attached for details!What I am sharing my opinion on are they real key factors. How it feels, how it chews, how it taste, how it sits in the stomach and how it poops out. For the record, on a scale of 1-10, 10 being best score, I rate me a 1 when it comes to desire to eat healthy and an 8 at actually eating healthy. In fact, right now I am thinking cheesecake and not a healthy snack bar.PACKAGING – Score 9When it comes to the packaging, I find the package is easy to open, even after sitting in my back pocket before a 10 mile run. The bar is always cleanly in the packaging, not sticking too much too it. I have never had a struggle or frustration taking the food out of the package, an experience you always have with sugar daddy’s (of course, my pre-healthy days only).The package is sealed well and keeps the food tasting fresh.CHEW EFFECT – Score 9I like the texture. Once placed in the mouth, the heavens open up, doves flew out and WAM. Okay, maybe that does not happen, but the texture of the food is solid. It is not too hard or too chewy. When you’re done eating, the food is not crammed between teeth cracks or sticking to the top of the mouth.TASTE – Score 10Awesome. Perfect flavor. Not too sweet.SWALLOW EFFECT – Score 10Good. Repeat and it works great.STOMACH ACCEPTANCE – Score 10Simply awesome. My stomach when it comes to sensitivity is extremely high. If I eat items with too much sugar, my stomach turns. The bars sat well.  They do not sit heavy and they digest well. I never have an issue where gas is leaking out of me (or at least where I can blame it on the bars), so my digestive system pushes it a long well. I am sensitive to gluten, but still no issues.TOILET APPROVED – Score 10This part ended quick, fast and smooth. One big splash finished nature’s course and it was a blessing since lactose issues are normal for me.FAMILY APPROVED – Score 10Wife and Kids love them. Wife loves them because they are easy to store and pull when needed!FINAL COMMENTSGreat product, great flavor. If you are on the fence, try them, you will be impressed.Let me know if the review was helpful!"

If you've every tried to find a fruit type snack that doesn't have a ton of added sugar, you know there's not many options available. These are great because they're made with only fruit, they won't melt or freeze if I leave them in my car, awesome snack for when my blood sugar drops and I need a quick snack, and the kids I nanny for love them as well so I always keep extras in my purse. I love the organic ones but they're pretty pricey but these are certified non-GMO so that's a second best winner for me and the price is good for the amount you get."

Great snack to grab and go for kids or adults. No added sugar or corn syrup! It is just pureed fruit. Since fruit can go bad or get bruised en route, these are an easy form to bring on outings or camping. Keep a few on hand for when the neighbor kids come over. Easy to fit in a purse, backpack, sports bag or lunch. Healthier than chips, candy and pop for kids. My family loves the variety of flavors. They are even mom-approved.

They take no room at all so I often have a few in my purse too just in case I am stuck somewhere and the kids need a little something to eat.  I have purchased this I don't even know how many times and I can say that it's usually very good but sometimes some flavors are very rough and chewy, as if they were an old batch or something.  Other than that, it's pretty good and good value.  My local supermarket carries these individually and they can even go for $1 each and the least they charge is 2 for $1, so either way this has worked out very well for me."

I now find the Cherry flavor to be inedible (luckily hubby eats them!) and Apple to be one of my favorites. Still worth buying and eating 🙂Old review: I was looking for a fruit snack made entirely of fruit, with no added sugar, and discovered these fruit strips. This package contains 6 different flavors, of which Apple is my least favorite and Cherry or Grape are my most. Yes, these are still processed fruit snacks, but, they're better than gummy bears (what I'm using them to replace), and with this brand you're eating actual fruit, not fruit flavors mixed with high fructose corn syrup.

1626,Christopher N.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 9, 2019",Delicious but could use more nuts,  This mix is sooooo tasty! I buy two bags of this a month to have a healthy and tasty snack to eat at work. I love all of the ingredients here and they all work well together. I wish there was a higher concentration of nuts in here to give it a little less sugar and make it more filling but I'll usually just add more nuts to the mix on my own.
1627,linrick,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2018",No date on package.,  I bought 3 bags along with 2 protein packed trail mixes.  The protein packed has a date stamped on the bottom of 10/09/19 and tasted fresh.  The omega packs has no date anywhere on the bags that I could find.  They smell oily and nuts tasted old.UPDATE:  I reordered and still no date on bags.  Good thing though that these bags taste great with so much fresher ingredients.  Changed my rating to 4 stars from previous 1.

1629,GrayFox,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2019","The whole mix is great, but the chocolate makes it worth ordering.","  I think this is a fantastic price for such a great trail mix.We initially had this on a plane when we were flying home from Cozumel. I thought maybe it was the travel fatigue, and the increasing hunger pangs due to flying through lunch, that made the chocolate in this taste so good at the time. The obvious next logical step was to hunt it down on Amazon, in order to test out the flavor more scientifically in the comfort of my own home.It turns out the chocolate chunks really are that good. Everything else is good too! But the chocolate is the real star here.In conclusion, maybe order it and pick out all the chocolate pieces and then pour the rest into a ziplock bag and be like ""look at this trail mix I made!"" and your family will be none the wiser and they'll be happy you got them a delicious trail mix, and you'll be happy to have the chocolate pieces hidden away for the days when you need to eat hidden away chocolate."

I just opened my second  package of 8 ct. eatsmart snacks. 3 out of 8 individual packages had 1 to 5 chips in them! The packaging system must have gone nuts. I opened 3 bags and got 11 chips. They did not total even 1 normal package.  Those 3 bags were rather costly!
1631,Abi,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2018",This is how they stack up to the big brands....,"  The main ingredient is potato, so these are essentially just chips. They are baked instead of fried, which helps keep the calories down. A little bland, but OK.For anyone curious, a regular bag of plain Lays chips is right around 6 calories per gram, plain Lays baked chips are 4 calories per gram, whereas these are only 2.13 calories per gram."

I have been looking for chip-like snacks that are a little less unhealthy and I think I have found them in these. This is THE BEST way to get my guys to eat tomatoes (they won't eat them in any food or by themselves, so in chip form is all I can do) and spinach when they think they are getting an unhealthy snack, they are actually getting a little bit of nutrients.These are in nice 100 calorie bags which make them super convenient for quick snacks or for adding to a lunch box for school or work."

I like the small portion controlled bags and the chips stay fresher longer bagged in small quantities. The taste is OK but not great. My sister thinks they are awful and my husband says they are bland. Honestly, no one I know likes them but me. And I don't like them like I do other lower fat/calorie chip products..I even like veggie straws better.They're not like my beloved Pringles or Ruffles or even baked chips but they have the crunch, the saltiness, and a decent flavor, They serve the purpose of having a crunchy chip but I don't crave them or choose them over other similar products. I won't buy them often but they do come in handy when I want a salty snack but don't want to indulge in potato chips."
1634,Thehealthygoth,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2017",Great for portion control,"  I love these chips! This package comes with 8 backs of 100 calorie bags of chips and it's a decent portion. This is my go to (along with popcorn) to fufill the crunchy chip craving without going overboard on calories. The shape makes them good for dipping too! I eat them with 1-2 tablespoons of hummus, a triangle of the soft laughing cow cheese, or salsa but they're tasty on their own too. If you wanted to save some money you could probably buy a big bag a a grocery store and portion into little zip lock bags yourself but these are just so quick and easy to grab that I can't help buying them!"
1635,Lisa J Fisk,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2019",Amazing chips!!,"  Very delicious. Has a great crisp! It satisfies that potato chip craving. It came well packaged. Unlike a small bag of potato chips, there's actually a decent amount per serving bag! Regular chips, you open the bag and there's like 5 chips or a bag of crumbs. So not worth it. These are better for you, great value, great serving size per bag, and they taste amazing!!!"
1636,Michelle,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2016",Yummy and easy!,"  I love veggie straws but have become hooked on these as well.  They're shaped more like a traditional chip and have a decent flavor without the grease or guilt. It's nice that you can eat them at work without getting crumbs and grease on your hands :-)  In my opinion they don't have as much flavor as veggie straws but that's okay because they're still delicious and healthier than traditional chips.  These 100 calorie packs are perfect to grab in the morning for a snack or part of your lunch.  When I'm wanting a little extra with them, I dip them in hummus and it's delicious."

I wasn’t sure what I was expecting. Of course I wouldn’t get them thinking they’d taste bad, but I wasn’t expecting them to remind me almost exactly of some super salty yummy Pringle’s! Very fresh, crunchy, and salty! Had them with a turkey and jalapeño wrap and they were a great side!"

Eventually i went online and that particular brand seemed too expensive in bulk so i went with this Trader Joe's version.

They are my new favorite low-carb snack, and perfect for when I feel like munching on something (like when I'm watching a movie).  I have type 1 diabetes, and have to watch my carb intake.  I consider these snacks to be a ""free food"" as they do not impact my blood sugar, and I do not need to take any insulin when I eat it. The ones I ordered did not have a wasabi taste to them, but a nice, pleasant, lightly roasted sesame taste.  They melt in your mouth and are a healthier alternative to chips, nuts, or popcorn when you need a little snack.I don't have a Trader Joe's where I live, so I'm glad I can order these from Amazon.  I will definitely be ordering more! :-)"
2295,Caroline,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2013","Delicious, but poor shipping methods","  Trader Joe's Roasted Seaweed Snacks are delicious.  I crave them the way most people crave potato chips.  They're low in calories (60 calories for the entire package) and contain beneficial minerals that you might not get elsewhere, so you can eat a ton of them without feeling guilty.  It's an excellent product.The problem was that these were shipped in a bag, not a box.  This would be fine if the plastic box inside the wrapping were rigid, but it's not.  Every box was flattened at some point during shipping.  Seaweed snacks don't really bend without breaking.  Everything was broken into little shards that drifted around the inside of the package during shipping, so when I went to open one of the packages, the seaweed on the outside of its container got all over the place.  Since these are made with oil, it's very hard to get little bits off of a surface.  Eating them without making a mess was equally difficult.  You'd think for $5 shipping the sellers would at least make sure the product made it to the buyer in one piece.  I wish they had taken the care to use a box rather than a bag.  What I really wish was that I'd just made the trip to Trader Joe's and bought them there.  I'm very disappointed."

Packaged in an airtight container, it is as fresh and crisp as the moment it was packed at the factory.  Each package has only 60 calories--and that's for two servings!  The seaweed comes in thin, rectangular sheets of a beautiful shade of green.  As you take a bite, the crisp sheet reminds you of biting into a potato chip or popcorn--crunch and a bit of salt.  Once on your tongue, it begins to dissolve, giving you a more gelatinous texture.  If you enjoy Japanese foods such as sushi, this is for you.What a great, low calorie alternative to take to the movies.  Or, to lunch, to eat at your desk, in the car, at sports events, on the plane.  Easy to handle, small, crunchy, salty, chewy.  M-m-m, just plain yummy."

2343,Michelle T,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 14, 2015",Worst purchase I have ever made!,"  Gave these 1 star only because there isn't a zero.  I wanted so much to like these due to the fact that they are healthier than other snack type foods but really- this is it???  Super expensive for what you get and boring, bland almost like eating paper.  In the garbage these went."

2348,Skayea,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2018",Not A Healthy Snack,"  I love roasted seaweed snacks. I have purchased these directly from a Trader Joe's store. This brand is on the bland and flimsy side of the seaweed snack spectrum, but they are tasty enough. The upside of seaweed snacks for me is the iodine content. If you've never tried seaweed snacks before, they may be an acquired taste. The downside is that they are made with canola oil which is unhealthy because it inhibits enzyme function among other effects. There are other brands which are canola-free. Had these been canola-free, I could only wish that the people who dumped theirs in the trash would have sent them my way. Based on that fact that there are seaweed snacks with healthier ingredients, I won't be buying these again. In fact, I will try making them at home with a recipe found in my search for canola-free snacks. If you do eat these, you may experience digestive upsets if you consume more than a few at a time. I don't know if it's because of the canola oil or if it's seaweed-related, but this seems to be a common side effect."
2349,Dan & T. Martin,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2015",Great for hypothyroid .. DOES NOT contribute to acne & Good price & Taste great,"  At first I gave this a low-rating, since I thought it contributed to my kid's acne.  After 1 year of using this, I upgrade to 5-stars.  It has zero effect on my teenager's acne, but helps her hypothyroid, since Kelp has iodine, necessary for thyroid function.  This product also has 8% vitamin A (helps with skin & thyroid), plus 20% vitamin C, and 2% iron.  One pack has only 30 calories, and only 99 cents at Trader's Joe.I notice that I nap easier when I snack on this for breakfast.  I appreciate this product for is low-cost, low-calories, and how it helps my teenager daughter with her hypothyroid .. her skin is clear, despite having one pack per day.  Seaweed has minerals:  iodine, potassium, magnesium, calcium and iron."

2351,Karbush,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 20, 2016",Too much packaging but tastes great,"  These taste great and are nutritious -- my 9 year old son who won't eat anything but meat and junk food (chips, french fries, etc) loves them. Here is my complaint: the packaging creates a LOT of waste. I try to get him to cut up the plastic--its bulky and takes up a lot of space in the trash can/recycle bin. And the outer wrapping does not ball up well either. I am looking for a company that packages theirs differently but is as economical and tasty as this. Anyone know of one?"
2352,Serena Reed,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2014",Yummy!,"  These seaweed snacks are definitely not for everyone, but worth trying.  If you like sushi then you will recognize the flavor of the wrapper.  My daughter and I picked some up just to try, then we were both trying not to eat them all.  They are so good!  They are crunchy, crispy and very flavorful.  They aren't too salty either.  I don't like salty foods.  The sesame oil added the perfect touch of flavor to put them over the top.  My husband also thought that they were okay, but he wasn't crazy about the thin paper-like consistency.  That texture is what I thinks makes them great for a healthy snack.  You don't need to eat a lot to get the flavors."
2353,BLONDEinGV,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2012",Surprisingly...Awesome!,"  I'm no vegetarian, and am certainly not a ""granola girl,"" yet I find these so amazingly tasty! There's just a moderately salty crunch at first, and then they basically ""melt in your mouth."" The flavor is exactly like the seaweed wrapped around sushi rolls; no ""fishy"" taste.Like other reviewers, I initially decided to try these because (1) they're crazy-low in calories, and (2) I'd heard about how healthy seaweed is. So glad I did! These - remarkably - satisfy my husband's salty-crunchy cravings, so we don't buy any potato chips/tortilla chips/pretzels/popcorn anymore!I really wanted to dock a star for (1) wanting to eat more than are in each package (aka: the package is too small), and (2) because they're pretty pricey compared to other salty-crunchy snacks. But, I just couldn't do it. They are too darn delicious! I would buy these in bulk at Sam's Club if I could!Side note: I haven't done any research on the health benefits of dried v. fresh seaweed. I suspect that fresh has many more vitamins/nutrients, but that's purely my own speculation. If anyone has any info on this...please comment on my review so I can take a look. Thanks!"
2354,NICOLE BILLERA,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2016",Addicted.,  I get these from trader joes. I had them a few years ago and HATED them!!! Thought they were nasty! Fast forward to now. I am eating a low carb diet and wanted a snack so I bought some knowing my husband likes them so if I hated them again it wouldn't go to waste. I tried one... ugh... yuck. Tried it once more and then I was hooked. Now I am lucky if I don't eat a whole package.  It is an acquired taste. So you really can't judge by the reviews. I once hated them now I love them.
2355,LC,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2012",If heaven came in a bag ...,"  It would be called Trader Joe's Roasted Seaweed Snack.These dried pieces of seaweed are lightly coated in sesame oil and salt for a crisp, delicious snack. I'd never tried roasted seaweed before but I decided to give them a try. Needless to say, I now consider myself a seaweed addict.Seaweed has many healthy things in it that we most likely don't get from other sources of food we eat. The best thing about this snack is that you can eat the whole bag (and trust me, you will) and it's only 60 calories.You will pay a lot lower price if you buy it in the store rather than from Amazon. Not everyone has a local store to them so at least you have somewhere to buy this yummy treat!"

So days later, had more....okay I could deal with them a little better.Then, days later I realized I was sitting at my computer & just popping them into my mouth & I was REALLY LIKING THEM A LOT.  Only 60 calories for the whole package.  They are flakey, lightly crunchy, & lightly salty in tast.  Sure beats having potato chips.

The packets are easily one serving. The wasabi flavor is really good too! It has a bite to it that can be overwhelming if you are gorging on them like I do, so I  like to alternate between the plain and the wasabi to even out the flavor a little. Very healthy little treat. Word of advice, though: if you have an Asian grocery nearby, get them there instead of TJs. You can get a much larger quantity for a lot less money!"

2366,Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2012",Addictive and delicious!,"  This review is going to sound very different from a normal one.First off, I would like to point out that yes, I gave it four stars on purpose.  Please keep that in mind and read this very thoroughly.I hate these snacks.  I hate them because they are so insanely addictive, I find it nearly impossible to ""just have one.""  Invariably, I end up consuming the entire package grinning like a giddy schoolchild.  Even if I put them away, I will inevitably find myself searching the package out, just so I can have one more.. and then again, and again, until the package is finally empty, and then I am sad.I hate them because of their fun, paper-thin texture, which makes it seem like you've some piece of unique candy, then it turns out to be a delicious, slightly salty, somewhat chewy snack which makes your brain scream 'Oooh, yay, SUSHI!' only for it to suddenly turn nutty in a twist which makes me want to have just one more to experience that fun crinkle of the sheets (for they are super-thin sheets of dried, roasted seaweed), the YAY of incoming sushi, that slightly chewy transformation, and then they dissolve into almost nothingness, leaving you reaching for another one.I hate them because the pack lasts about 45 minutes.  An hour and a half, if I'm demonstrating exceptionally strong willpower for the day.  Possibly longer if I can manage to convince someone *else* to hide them from me.I hate them because said pack gives me 40% of my Vitamin C for the day in less than half an ounce of actual dried seaweed.  And something that tastes so very delicious isn't supposed to be that healthy.  Bacon doesn't give vitamin C.  These snacks do.  That's confusing.  Snacks are supposed to be guilty pleasures, not delightful dietary supplements.I hate them because the only physical store that carries them in my area is Trader Joe's, and I always end up opening the pack after they are closed.  So when the package is empty and I am sad, I must wait until morning to ""get my fix"" again.I hate them because I ate an entire package while writing this review.  And now it is gone.  And now I am sad.  Thankfully, though, I can get them here and have them delivered to my door.  I might have to order a few of the six packs, though, to last me until the next order I place can arrive.  I'm working out a rationing calendar that I probably won't stick to for more than an hour.And finally, I hate that I don't hate these at all, but am hopelessly and utterly addicted to them.  Seaweed Anonymous, thou art my name."

2368,Kindle Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2011",awesome!,"  I like this one better than Annie Chun's brand because it is lower in sodium, 50mg instead of 70ml.  The other one is too salty for my taste.  However Annie Chun's brand has a better aroma since it is roasted in sesame oil.  Every time I buy them, 20 at a time, I got a lot of stares from the people in line!  :)  My daughter, who is 4, can eat 2 packs of Trader Joe's brand at a time but she wouldn't eat but 2 sheets from Annie Chun's."

Growing up deeply entrenched in Asian cuisine, I knew before trying it that it was more than likely not going to be to my tastes. If you like products such as grass jelly or sushi, or anything that is pungent and tastes like plant material without being om nom nom delicious, this is for you.This product is not recommended for small children. There's not enough sugar in it.This product is also not recommended for vegans and seliacs. While it is gluten free and animal-product free, you can do something better for yourselves by finding an alternative snack without the bay water flavor.This product is not recommended for people with heart disease or who are at risk for developing heart disease. It's a high sodium choice.This product is not recommended for alcoholics. You'll start drinking again.This product is not recommended for cigarette smokers. Save your money for your cancer sticks.This product IS recommended for users of Mountain Dew, grass or ai ju jelly, pickled radish, bean thread, sushi, menudo, mole sauce, adobo sauce, specialty bell peppers, bouncy balls, pencil and pen erasers, rubber soles, rubber in general, motor oil, gasoline/petrol, radioactive isotopes, unidentified rare earth metals, tapeworms, Buffalo Bills fans, fruit cake, Hostess snacks, corn, rat, and/or chicken snakes, parents of teenagers (for use as a punishment agent on those late night sneak outs), water bottles, organic milk, Tuscan Whole Milk, Three Wolf Moon shirts, wolf shirts in general, Twilight readers, and insomniacs.The flavor matches wonderfully with a fresh whole rabbit, such as the one listed on this site.I would rate it higher than two stars in the regards that it's a wonderful seaweed product.

However, upon trying a packet, they had a very nasty stale taste. I know how these should taste as I have, over the past 10 years purchased many from supermarkets. So when I got this package, I could wait to try a pack. They tasted so bad I had to spit out what was in my mouth.

Unfortunately the replacement was the same batch and expiration date, and tasted the same, rancid. But Amazon would not accept a return (their bot is so structured) and I have to dispose of two unusable boxes and eat the expense.

It doesn't taste like most of the over processed junk out there. My 9 year old daughter loves the blue chips and I don't feel badly packing a bag for school snack. They can be a bit pricey but Amazon offers a pretty good deal. I'm just leery after my last experience."
2395,Rachel K.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2016",Wise choice for people who need to count on calories,"  So far the best potato chip I ever had. It's crispy yet without traditional oil frying. It has incredibly low calories compared to regular potato chips which I like. When you think about snack chips available in the market, you can't really find something that is ""healthier choice"" but Terra Chips give you variety option of baked chip without the trans fats, real vegetables, with no sodium option. It has over 25 different varieties available.Nice thing about this chips are it comes with smaller package which is about 28 grams while other regular brand chips come with 50 grams. I have tried original recipe, sweet potatoes, taro, and my favorite blue potatoes. Unlike real veggies, it will come with all the calories and fat of a regular chip but with healthier version. It has a line of no-added salt version which is good to manage their sodium level.Packaging was superior, all of my 24 chips come in one box without scattered pieces. I can't wait to try different varieties when they have more promotional sale.Tip: Price changes constantly, just monitor the price to grab a best deal.

2396,Sophie,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2015",Need to find them in larger sizes,"  Had these on JetBlue a couple of times and was hooked. I looked at several health food stores for them and came up empty-handed, although they had Terra brand chips.  I wonder why this flavor are so hard to find.  The small bags may be fine as a free snack on an airplane, but it felt wasteful as a snack at home.  All the little bags.  One is never enough and you reach for another. And another.  I felt like I was paying more for air than for chips.  The chips were generally delicious, but some bags had chips that seemed stale and more tough than what I had on JetBlue.  But next time I'm hunting for these chips, I will want to find them in regular size bags."

The bag wrapping is apparently hand-made. The aluminum wrapping looks genuine. But the plastic containers in it are all deformed. The seaweeds are stale and tasteless. Oh, did I mention the price is twice I paid at Costco warehouse? I am positive this is a fraudulent product. Costco and Amazon  needs to investigate this crime!

Perfect to replace Potato Chips as snake, put on Fish Sandwiches, Shrimp Salads, Pizza and any Fish Sui-chi Dish making all crunchy when biting into them. Adds great flavor as well.  Lately, it has been hit or miss at Costco, sometimes have them, then sold out. Amazon deliveries are just great as well if they will match the price and quantity.  I know the seaweed is sold in different flavors but i can't tell the difference just a great ocean taste. Highly recommend the product and is a big hit at parties or serving with other dishes for guests. One is wary at first look and bite but try a few and you won't by Potatoes Chips for a long time.  Total fat 1.5 Grams with 1 Gram of Protein per 20 Flakes servings. Zero Saturated or Trans Fats, Carbs, or Sugars either.

Amazon now sells a similar cracker that's just as tasty but ships in a solid plastic container which provides much better protection than the mylar bag of this cracker. I knocked a star off my original review as we are still dealing with this TWO YEARS LATER. It's an unfortunate situation because these are otherwise very delicious crackers that are marred and tainted only by its packaging and shipping practices.We order these in the flexible mylar bag. The crackers have a great taste and are a favorite of our family. Unfortunately, we always receive these with nearly half of the crackers crushed because they are shipped in a soft, flexible envelope packaging. Order at your own risk."

And many others I've tried just pale in comparison, seriously, they're a very light color or actually white and there's very little taste.Beware - This particular brand of arare  contain MSG.  So those of you who freak out about this ingredient or are sensitive to it - stay away.The bag came full to the brim in its own resealable bag. The bag itself is pretty thick and I hope the seal is tight enough to keep them fresh.  Nothing worse than getting some of these and the next day or two and they're stale.  In comparing these to the Asia Trans brand, I find these to have a better flavor; that's probably the addition on the msg, but I'll take it.The two bags came in a single box, without  paper or plastic bubble packs so they wouldn't bang around and break into cracker dust.  So I was surprised to find that they're mostly intact.  I poured some in a bowl, tried to get pieces from the bottom as well.  You can see that there are not a lot of broken pieces despite there not being any padding. I also put some on the paper with a bottle cap to show scale, since these are not very large.  I also included a picture of the expiration date, a little over eight months from now.Overall, I'm very satisfied with these and would buy them again.  I'm not sure I'd share them just yet, maybe just direct them to Amazon so they can get their own pack."
2615,GMak,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2016","Delicious, delicious, delicious","  These taste great!  I grew up eating arare (rice crackers) so I consider myself somewhat of a rice cracker snob.  I would always want the pieces that were the darkest, they were either toasted the most or had the most soy sauce on them, either way they had the best flavor.  If you are the kind of person that likes the browned bits of rice that sits in the bottom of your rice cooker then you know what I mean.  These crackers are nice and dark, full of flavor and very crispy.  So many of the rice crackers you see in stores today are pale and don't look too appetizing.  I was somewhat cautious about ordering these rice crackers since they were made in Taiwan and in my opinion the best ones come from Japan.  However these are absolutely delicious. I read that some people have had issues with broken pieces (NOT ME) or the price (about $12.00 per pound).  An 8 ounce package of rice crackers locally sells for $5.00-5.50, That's $10-11 per pound for much inferior rice crackers.  These are not cheap but well worth the price.  I won't be buying them every week, but maybe once a month????"
2616,J. Au,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2017",My go to brand for mochi crunch,"  This is one of the best mochi crunch brand there is.  I've tried many different brands and as far as the taste goes.  This is one of the best.  For one, it doesn't taste too salty like some other arare.  I also like the convenience of having to purchase this myself with free prime shipping (with membership).  The fact that I don't have to bother my friends or relatives there.  Just get this myself.  It's an expensive product, but, 2 lbs, 6 oz, that's alot of mochi crunch in one bottle.  I don't know of any other company that does that.  I think is because they have such a great product that people are willing to pay for a full bottle of arare.  Besides the point, I could continue to make my furikake mochi crunch butter popcorn (similar to hurricane popcorn).  Just as tasty but, better flavor."
2617,Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2019","Great taste, poor shipping","   I was very satisfied with the taste and freshness of the crackers. As I poured them out of the bag, I realized the same thing that many other reviewers stated...there was a lot of small, crushed pieces. I ordered the large golden-colored bag and it was shipped in a soft package. Maybe that is what caused so much damage. I did not serve these at my party as anticipated and will be contacting o company. Crackers cost too much to be shipped in such poor condition."
2618,D. O. Johnson,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2020",TOTALLY Unacceptable,"  First off, let me say I have in the past always ordered the Aloha brand mix and been extremely satisfied. However when I saw this product with a greater quantity for approximately the same price, I decided to chance it. Bad mistake.When I first opened the package and tasted the mix it was similar to the Aloha brand, but not quite as intense. Still it had an acceptable and pleasing flavor. However when I poured out some mix in a bowl, I was shocked to see that at least the third if not more of all of the small pieces we're broken. See my photo. In fact when I looked closely I saw that there were pieces that were plain and others that had seaweed in them. It was obvious to me that these are what was swept up from several different production lines, not the high-quality product that I expected.Although I did eventually consume the whole bag, it was irritating because the number of broken pieces got larger and larger till the very bottom where everything was small and crushed.Save your money and aggravation. Buy the Aloha brand instead."
2619,Uccello Blu,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2020",Contains MSG,"  This updates a previous review.  The taste and crispness of Tomoe is our favorite.  However, I've asked the shipper to bubble wrap and box it for shipping to prevent receiving lots of crumbs.  Request ignored.  They continue to ship it in an envelope.  We continue to get a bag with a considerable amount of crumbs.  We also found out that although Tomoe is known not to use MSG in their arare, this package version does contain MSG.  They advertise in their description on Amazon no MSG.  Read the ingedients on the package.  MSG is one of the ingredients.  We will not be ordering this again :-("
2620,MonCho,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2019",So Good!,"  I grew up on Umeya rice crackers- when I was a kid we'd always get the jumbo bags of them from the Umeya store in downtown Los Angeles. Since Umeya is no more, I started looking for a good alternative. The best tasting and best deal I've found is the Tomoe Brand Hawaiian Mix Arare in the jumbo bag. These have really good flavor and the 38 oz bag lasts for a while. One big plus is they don't use those chemical food coloring dyes to make their Arare like a lot of the other companies do. My only regret is not finding these sooner. Anyway buy a bag- you won't regret it!"
2621,bobmac,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2019",Tastes good but mostly broken,"  If you like rice crackers, real rice crackers with good flavor these are for you.  If they are so good why did I only give them 3 stars?  90% of the crackers were broken and I threw away a large part of the bag since they were “dust”.  I would buy more but it makes no sense to buy something where you throw away so much of the product.  I do not blame the shipping either.  I believe these were broken well before they were shipped to me.  They did have a very nice flavor though."
2622,Stormvoël,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2020",Good... but no difference in taste among the shapes.,"  Usually, when I buy rice crackers, there is a distinct difference in taste in the assortment.  Some are sweet, some are salty, some spicy, some taste of the nori shreds on them.  These all taste the same, with the same coating;  the only thing different is in the shape.  Not exactly what I was expecting.However, they do taste good:  nicely salty, fresh, and crunchy.  I'm knocking off one star because it appeared that this would be a true assortment and it's not.  But... I've ordered several other types of rice crackers to mix into it (especially chili bits!), and then I'll have the snack assortment of my dreams  :-DBy the way, these crackers do go extremely well with peanut-butter-stuffed pretzel bites if you like the latter."
2623,Alice Jones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2018",The Best!,"  So yummy!  This is the flavor I’ve been looking for.  So often rice cracker mixes have those white ones that are too bland.  This mix is all really well toasted and coated with soy sauce seasoning. Crunchy and wonderful!Update:  My latest order arrive with a hole in the side fold large enough to put three fingers in.  Amazon drew lines through my review of the seller, and accepted responsibility.  We’re in a pandemic and I certainly don’t want opened food, but Amazon hasn’t offered to replace or refund and they won’t answer the phone.  Their customer service seems to be slipping."
2624,DonnieBoy,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2020",Hard little soy rocks!,"  I grew up in Hawaii, and I ate arare literally every day, we had arare stores all over the island.  So I think I know how arare should taste and crunch.  The flavor was very nice, my only problem I have with these crackers is they are hard as ROCKS, much more crunchy than I can even endure.  My bag is still mostly full because I can't chew them very good, so I just suck on them for the soy coating, and discard  the crackers after a minute or so.  A disappointment in this purchase 😟"

My order arrived promptly and the arare was fresh both times that I ordered it.  It is a bit expensive but when you consider buying it in the individual bags, the price isn't too bad. If it's shipped from Hawaii, that's even better!  I like this brand of arare.  It has a nice flavor and is very crunchy. There is seaweed or nori in the crackers but not alot.  Anyway I hope this seller stays on Amazon for a long time so that I can continue to get my awesome supply of my favorite rice crackers. No more mooching and begging the relatives to send me some!"

Not exactly the same, but so very close.  The only reason it didn't get a 5 star is the pricing for such a small bag.  I was expecting a larger bag, but will buy them again.

2866,Kc T. ,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2019",Delicious but Must Be Shared,"  These Golden Duck Gourmet Salted Egg Yolk Fish Skin Crisps Chips were undeniably delicious. Crispy, a little spicy, and they just melt in your mouth. My wife, who is incredibly picky when it comes to chips, found these to be fragrant and crispy ( as the name suggests) and actually requested that we ordered more in the future, to my surprise!I do want to note that given that these are pretty oily, so eating too much will definitely lead to a bit of throat uncomfortableness. It's really a matter of self-control when making sure that you don't eat all the crisps in one sitting. With some tea or some water, I think that these chips are much easier to digest, and you'll definitely thank me later for the tip. If only they sold these chips in my hometown, I'd be purchasing them monthly for the whole family to enjoy! For the price that you pay, it is also a little expensive; most chip bags do have quite a bit of air though. It is undeniable, however, that the bags are fresh, and the fish used is fresh and results in chips that are fare from stale."

Davis,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 21, 2013","Not the first brand i've tried, and not bad at all...  :)","  This is now the second brand of seaweed snacks that i've tried.I had held onto an empty package of ""Sea Veggies[tm]"" that i purchased from a local Kroger's store for *months*, telling myself if i ever get to that Kroger's again i'll need to buy more of these 'cause they're a great snack...  Eventually i went online and that particular brand seemed too expensive in bulk so i went with this Trader Joe's version.  Honestly, i can't tell them apart (though admittedly it's best a few months or more since i had that competing brand).When i finish the last of these i'll move on to another brand and review those, too.  ^_^"

It has the healthy /meaning green and fishy taste. I teach health and wellness and do not always eat things for there taste but for energy . The little bag is filling and certainly helps me not to crave potato chips and sweets. I am really pleased. Right now my review is a 4, I would not be surprised If I write one with a 5 later. I bet I will come around to really enjoying them. Just be warned ahead. It took me back a little at first as I did not know what to expect.Hope this helps"

They are my new favorite low-carb snack, and perfect for when I feel like munching on something (like when I'm watching a movie).  I have type 1 diabetes, and have to watch my carb intake.  I consider these snacks to be a ""free food"" as they do not impact my blood sugar, and I do not need to take any insulin when I eat it. The ones I ordered did not have a wasabi taste to them, but a nice, pleasant, lightly roasted sesame taste.  They melt in your mouth and are a healthier alternative to chips, nuts, or popcorn when you need a little snack.I don't have a Trader Joe's where I live, so I'm glad I can order these from Amazon.  I will definitely be ordering more! :-)"
2931,Caroline,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2013","Delicious, but poor shipping methods","  Trader Joe's Roasted Seaweed Snacks are delicious.  I crave them the way most people crave potato chips.  They're low in calories (60 calories for the entire package) and contain beneficial minerals that you might not get elsewhere, so you can eat a ton of them without feeling guilty.  It's an excellent product.The problem was that these were shipped in a bag, not a box.  This would be fine if the plastic box inside the wrapping were rigid, but it's not.  Every box was flattened at some point during shipping.  Seaweed snacks don't really bend without breaking.  Everything was broken into little shards that drifted around the inside of the package during shipping, so when I went to open one of the packages, the seaweed on the outside of its container got all over the place.  Since these are made with oil, it's very hard to get little bits off of a surface.  Eating them without making a mess was equally difficult.  You'd think for $5 shipping the sellers would at least make sure the product made it to the buyer in one piece.  I wish they had taken the care to use a box rather than a bag.  What I really wish was that I'd just made the trip to Trader Joe's and bought them there.  I'm very disappointed."

Packaged in an airtight container, it is as fresh and crisp as the moment it was packed at the factory.  Each package has only 60 calories--and that's for two servings!  The seaweed comes in thin, rectangular sheets of a beautiful shade of green.  As you take a bite, the crisp sheet reminds you of biting into a potato chip or popcorn--crunch and a bit of salt.  Once on your tongue, it begins to dissolve, giving you a more gelatinous texture.  If you enjoy Japanese foods such as sushi, this is for you.What a great, low calorie alternative to take to the movies.  Or, to lunch, to eat at your desk, in the car, at sports events, on the plane.  Easy to handle, small, crunchy, salty, chewy.  M-m-m, just plain yummy."

2984,Skayea,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2018",Not A Healthy Snack,"  I love roasted seaweed snacks. I have purchased these directly from a Trader Joe's store. This brand is on the bland and flimsy side of the seaweed snack spectrum, but they are tasty enough. The upside of seaweed snacks for me is the iodine content. If you've never tried seaweed snacks before, they may be an acquired taste. The downside is that they are made with canola oil which is unhealthy because it inhibits enzyme function among other effects. There are other brands which are canola-free. Had these been canola-free, I could only wish that the people who dumped theirs in the trash would have sent them my way. Based on that fact that there are seaweed snacks with healthier ingredients, I won't be buying these again. In fact, I will try making them at home with a recipe found in my search for canola-free snacks. If you do eat these, you may experience digestive upsets if you consume more than a few at a time. I don't know if it's because of the canola oil or if it's seaweed-related, but this seems to be a common side effect."

They are crunchy, crispy and very flavorful.  They aren't too salty either.  I don't like salty foods.  The sesame oil added the perfect touch of flavor to put them over the top.  My husband also thought that they were okay, but he wasn't crazy about the thin paper-like consistency.  That texture is what I thinks makes them great for a healthy snack.

So glad I did! These - remarkably - satisfy my husband's salty-crunchy cravings, so we don't buy any potato chips/tortilla chips/pretzels/popcorn anymore!I really wanted to dock a star for (1) wanting to eat more than are in each package (aka: the package is too small), and (2) because they're pretty pricey compared to other salty-crunchy snacks. But, I just couldn't do it. They are too darn delicious! I would buy these in bulk at Sam's Club if I could!Side note: I haven't done any research on the health benefits of dried v. fresh seaweed.

It has a bite to it that can be overwhelming if you are gorging on them like I do, so I  like to alternate between the plain and the wasabi to even out the flavor a little. Very healthy little treat. Word of advice, though: if you have an Asian grocery nearby, get them there instead of TJs. You can get a much larger quantity for a lot less money!"

But here I am, telling you to run, not walk, to your local Trader Joe's store and pick up a few of these packs to snack on in the car. You may not believe it, but you will LOVE these delicious salty snacks!"
2999,Internet Man,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2012",So good!,  A buddy of mine offered me a piece of his seaweed snack and at first I was hesitant to try it since I'm a picky eater but after trying that first piece I came back for several more.  I had to stop myself from eating his whole bag.
3000,Kate Jessica Gallaher,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2013",Can't get enough!,"  Love these! I seriously cannot get enough of them..I go into TJ's and come out with a bag full. I bring them to work for a midday snack and have gotten all my coworkers hooked on them too. They had about three - four shelves fully stocked with this at my local TJ's...i was in heaven!!HOWEVER I must say, if you do not enjoy seaweed/sushi or just that general oceany/fishy taste in food this is most likely not for you...As everyone else is saying...it's good & good for you I do wish the packaging was bigger, but the product itself is by far 5 stars!"
3001,Steel Horse,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2011",Too addictive,"  It's suspicious when it's 8pm, rainy, and I'm contemplatinga run to Trader Joes for seaweed... Are we so sure it's onlyseaweed and salt?  Whatever it is I LOVE IT. Great snackwith very little guilt attached."
3002,Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2012",Addictive and delicious!,"  This review is going to sound very different from a normal one.First off, I would like to point out that yes, I gave it four stars on purpose.  Please keep that in mind and read this very thoroughly.I hate these snacks.  I hate them because they are so insanely addictive, I find it nearly impossible to ""just have one.""  Invariably, I end up consuming the entire package grinning like a giddy schoolchild.  Even if I put them away, I will inevitably find myself searching the package out, just so I can have one more.. and then again, and again, until the package is finally empty, and then I am sad.I hate them because of their fun, paper-thin texture, which makes it seem like you've some piece of unique candy, then it turns out to be a delicious, slightly salty, somewhat chewy snack which makes your brain scream 'Oooh, yay, SUSHI!' only for it to suddenly turn nutty in a twist which makes me want to have just one more to experience that fun crinkle of the sheets (for they are super-thin sheets of dried, roasted seaweed), the YAY of incoming sushi, that slightly chewy transformation, and then they dissolve into almost nothingness, leaving you reaching for another one.I hate them because the pack lasts about 45 minutes.  An hour and a half, if I'm demonstrating exceptionally strong willpower for the day.  Possibly longer if I can manage to convince someone *else* to hide them from me.I hate them because said pack gives me 40% of my Vitamin C for the day in less than half an ounce of actual dried seaweed.  And something that tastes so very delicious isn't supposed to be that healthy.  Bacon doesn't give vitamin C.  These snacks do.  That's confusing.  Snacks are supposed to be guilty pleasures, not delightful dietary supplements.I hate them because the only physical store that carries them in my area is Trader Joe's, and I always end up opening the pack after they are closed.  So when the package is empty and I am sad, I must wait until morning to ""get my fix"" again.I hate them because I ate an entire package while writing this review.  And now it is gone.  And now I am sad.  Thankfully, though, I can get them here and have them delivered to my door.  I might have to order a few of the six packs, though, to last me until the next order I place can arrive.  I'm working out a rationing calendar that I probably won't stick to for more than an hour.And finally, I hate that I don't hate these at all, but am hopelessly and utterly addicted to them.  Seaweed Anonymous, thou art my name."
3003,J. Schupp,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2012",very good and VERY addictive,  just a nice snack to munch on. it doesn't have a lot of calories and it's very light and crispy. trader joe's sells them for only 99 cents a pack so you can't beat the price!
3004,Kindle Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2011",awesome!,"  I like this one better than Annie Chun's brand because it is lower in sodium, 50mg instead of 70ml.  The other one is too salty for my taste.  However Annie Chun's brand has a better aroma since it is roasted in sesame oil.  Every time I buy them, 20 at a time, I got a lot of stares from the people in line!  :)  My daughter, who is 4, can eat 2 packs of Trader Joe's brand at a time but she wouldn't eat but 2 sheets from Annie Chun's."
3005,Leon deVose,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2012",Delicious!  You Will Think You Are Being Bad...,"  All I can say is that they are deliciously seasoned, nicely textured and habit forming.  My son brought some home one night from his new job.  Now I am constantly craving this stuff.I must thank my son for making me a 'weed-head.Only four stars, because I need a bigger package!So if you see a guy outside Trader Joe's playing sax for TJ 'weed, please be generous to me - oops- to him."

3008,D. Pawl,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2011",these are so good and addictive...,"  Trader Joe's Roasted Seaweed Snack is delicious and a great way to take the edge off of hunger!  This snack is delicately toasted in sesame oil, and come in little wafer thin ""slices"" of seaweed. The package is definitely something you could take on the go. I am not sure as to how long they keep - not that they will last that long. A great alternative to potato chips and more fattening foods!"

It is like heaven in a package. Sooooo good. Run, don't walk, it's the best. Beats chips, pretzels and I even chose this over my beloved popcorn. FABULOUS!!!"
3011,Helen Scovel Grey,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2010",Great product but almost twice the price,"  My kid - and others - love these.  We can't buy enough of them.  Trader Joe's have occasionally been out of thembut has not been permanent. At our local one, they have been back in stock for quite a while now and we fortunately haveno trouble getting large quantities of them.  I was looking for some type of bulk deal but I admit my first reactionto having found this was the same as the first reviewer...  why would I pay so much more? I suppose it's possible Imay change my tune later...  The product itself is great.  ""Good and good for you."""

For .99 I figured I couldn't go wrong.  Yuck.  They taste like low tide.  I guess  they are authentic. I also had my son try them - who as a toddler would eat the cat's food (not because we fed it to him) and strangely to this day likes the smell of it.  Anyway, it made him gag.  I have never been disappointed with TJs.  Maybe these are good for all the crunchy granolas out there, and compared to other similar seaweed snack products, but we thought they were nasty."

When she asked me to try it, my face puckered.  It's possible that the taste was tainted (pun intended) by a trader joes dark chocolate/powerberry/dingleberry, but I'll be sticking to the chili lime cashews and wasabi almonds from now on."
3019,Proofs and Truths,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 27, 2012",It tastes like bay water.,"  I received a package of Trader Joe's Roasted Seaweed Snack for my 23rd birthday. Growing up deeply entrenched in Asian cuisine, I knew before trying it that it was more than likely not going to be to my tastes. If you like products such as grass jelly or sushi, or anything that is pungent and tastes like plant material without being om nom nom delicious, this is for you.This product is not recommended for small children. There's not enough sugar in it.This product is also not recommended for vegans and seliacs. While it is gluten free and animal-product free, you can do something better for yourselves by finding an alternative snack without the bay water flavor.This product is not recommended for people with heart disease or who are at risk for developing heart disease. It's a high sodium choice.This product is not recommended for alcoholics. You'll start drinking again.This product is not recommended for cigarette smokers. Save your money for your cancer sticks.This product IS recommended for users of Mountain Dew, grass or ai ju jelly, pickled radish, bean thread, sushi, menudo, mole sauce, adobo sauce, specialty bell peppers, bouncy balls, pencil and pen erasers, rubber soles, rubber in general, motor oil, gasoline/petrol, radioactive isotopes, unidentified rare earth metals, tapeworms, Buffalo Bills fans, fruit cake, Hostess snacks, corn, rat, and/or chicken snakes, parents of teenagers (for use as a punishment agent on those late night sneak outs), water bottles, organic milk, Tuscan Whole Milk, Three Wolf Moon shirts, wolf shirts in general, Twilight readers, and insomniacs.The flavor matches wonderfully with a fresh whole rabbit, such as the one listed on this site.I would rate it higher than two stars in the regards that it's a wonderful seaweed product. However, I don't like it. That's the definition of two stars."
3020,R. Beckner,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2013",D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S,"  Great snack, I could eat all 6 packs at one sitting. Not too salty, taste just right. (3 more words required)"

3023,LuxLady,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2018","Yes, it’s dangerously addictive","  Yes expensive for a snack... but worth it because it is such a treat. I will happily sacrifice 6 bags of regular potato chips just to have one bag of this. It arrived a few days ago from Hong Kong (the only other country they sell this out of). I told myself I would eat only a little and savor the rest. Yeah, the bag didn’t even last an hour. One thing I forgot to do was turn the bag upside down and give it a little shake so all the flavor can be dispersed. No worries though, I still ate it all anyway."
3024,Video Queen,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2018",Delicious but too pricey,"  I was recommended this product by a friend from Singapore where the product is made.

3025,K,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2019","Expensive, sort of chalky, slightly sweet.","  Though this is probably slightly healthier than regular chips, the flavor and texture are odd.  I like salted duck eggs and I like salmon skin, but this was a little bit sweet and smelled a bit fishy.Sweet + seafood + chalky texture from yolk = kinda weird/gross?Perhaps if this had been less chalky and just savory and spicy, it would've been better.  Seafood that's sweet and chalky is not appealing to me; I wish I had known the ""salted egg"" actually was a bit sugary in flavor."
3026,K,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2018",Delicious salty crispy goodness,"  It's so farrrr, but it taste so good. It's a shame you can only get the original from singapore and the company doesn't ship it internationally so you have to find 3rd party sellers. That said this brand of fish chips are really good. The chips r not overly salty, just the right amount of savory and not particularly strong smelling. There are also small crispy green stuff inside, not sure if it is basil or parsley or some other fragrant edible green."
3027,Paley,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2019",delicious as promised,"  So much flavor, lots of different notes of spices (chili, curry leaf), not just salted egg yolk. No fishiness like the other salt fish skin snack (of course that was much cheaper). After hearing that this is much better from different friends and watching an video about IRVINS founder, I was willing to shell out to try it and it delivered.Shipped from overseas and I expected it a month or two after I ordered, but pleasantly surprised I got it in East coast US in 2 weeks."
3028,M. Chang,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2019","Expensive, but worth it","  These do seem expensive, but it's a lot cheaper than trying to get a plane to Singapore to buy it yourself! These are as dangerously addictive as they claim to be, so I'd recommend you keep them someplace separate from your home so you don't end up eating the whole bag at once. Another thing you might do is immediately open the bag and separate the contents into smaller bags or containers so you somehow limit yourself (or slow yourself down)."

Some day maybe you will be able to get them at your local grocery store.  I cannot understand why these would not be available domestically.  Perhaps they are and I am just missing out."

3225,Trippet,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2020",Needs More Heat,"  Firstly, they have an odd taste.  I'm not sure how to describe it other than kind of earthy and vegetable at the same time.  I found that off putting.The crackers themselves are good.  They need more flavor, though.  My eyes barely watered and my nose was relatively dry when eating these.  I'm looking for a sinus flush reaction!  When I found clusters of crackers I got the one-two punch effect, but it dissipated quickly.  My husband could tell when I was eating these because they had an odor.  Our office is 37 feet long and I am behind a hutch.  He could smell them as he was coming up the stairs, which are across the room from my desk.  He would say, ""damnit, baby, are you eating Those Things again?!""  I would proudly smile and stuff another handful in my mouth as I nodded emphatically.  :DThe best thing about these - no Peas!  I never had to worry about cracking a tooth on a cracker that was denser than it was supposed to be and that's a big bonus.  Sometimes those peas are like stones!Unfortunately that flavor I can't quite describe was too detrimental and I can't bring myself to order more.  The search continues for a snack that will make me cry and clear my sinuses."
3226,Ayathehusker,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2019",Fresh and enough wasabi to burn your nostrils!!,"  These came fresh and well packaged in bubble wrap. Almost none of the rice crackers were broken, and I assume none of them broke in shipping. I decided to try these after reading other reviews about the strong wasabi presence, and they were correct. I ate a small handful at once and it actually made me sneeze, which IMO is fantastic. I find a lot of wasabi flavored snacks are weak, these are good and strong. Highly recommended, some of the best spicy arare crackers I've had."

3243,m b,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2019","All kinds of wrong, and absolutely addictive","  Man, there is so much that is wrong with pork scratchings, and I love them for every single thing.First, this product is not at all the same as pork rinds as you know them in the States. If you buy pork scratchings thinking they are the same, you will be revolted. If - like me, when I first came here - you buy pork rinds thinking they are the same as pork scratchings, you will be depressed at the state of modern humanity.Both products are made from pigs, and both taste of pork. There the resemblance ends.Now, my memory is that these used to be called pork crackling back in the day, a traditional British snack that you bought in the pub with a beer, or loosely packed in plastic bags from old-school butchers. But everyone called them pork scratchings, and the manufacturers fell into line some time ago.You do not want to think about why we called them pork scratchings, or about what they are, or what they look like. All you need to know is that they are delicious.What you get is a whole bunch of teeny, tiny packets of triple-fried pork skins. Little lumps of massive salted pork flavor from the skin and occasional flecks of meat, and supercharged umami from the generous coating of fat on each piece. In the butchers' version you could also sometimes find bonus treats like triple-fried hair or pig's nipple, but I've not found those here (shame!). It's the flavor, the umami, and the salt that you're buying here, and as I see it, in each teeny tiny packet you get twice as much flavor as in a big bag of US-style pork rinds. It's a bargain.To put it another way; you know those roasted seaweed snacks you can get from Korea? Healthy, delicate and nicely balanced whispers that melt in your mouth? British pork scratchings are the precise opposite of that.Have I mentioned the crunch? It's a great crunch. So good in fact, and so strong, that you won't even notice if you break a tooth when biting down. (Which was a distinct risk when eating pork scratchings back in the day. They seem to have pulled back a bit on the modern crunch. I blame dentists for that.)I love them and you will too (I'm assuming you're not a vegetarian if you're reading this review).You have been warned."
3244,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2018",You've found them. Your quest is finally over.,"  I know why you're here. You're looking for cracklings. Not pork rinds; cracklings. Pork rinds don't compare once you've gotten the itch. You've tasted the exquisite masterpiece that is the belly and still yearn; each piece deep fried until the fat has turned into a crisp honeycomb of bacon-like ecstacy, ensconced within the crunch of flavor-packed skin. Go no further, the great swine god has passed his favor upon you today. You've found sheer pork nirvana."

I received them today (surprisingly fast, less than 4 days in transit, so thank you Royal Mail and US Mail for satisfying my cravings!!! ) Thank you Mr. Porky, for your wonderful treats, your recipe is perfect!! I love the taste, the crunchiness, the serving size!!! I already had 2 bags (I am ketogenic and these come in perfectly  handy with the amount of fat I need and basically 0 carbs and sugar), my hubby had 1 but I have to hide the rest cause he is ready to devour more, I can feel it.I am Romanian living in California, U.S. and I have to agree with the other buyers and reviewers: the European recipe for pork scratchings is not the same with the American pork rinds. I personally LOVE the Brits, including the pork scratchings! Yummoo!!!"

Viva the UK!","  My family was stationed in England via the USAF in the 1980's. We lived off base (what they called, ""on the economy"") and a block from a nice village pub. My dad would go every other Saturday night while me, my siblings, and my mom would have family movie night at home. My dad would ask all of us kids which pub snacks he wanted us to bring home. My choice was always pork scratchings. Sunday morning we would awake to see our treats laid out for us on the dining room table.Now, I live back in the USA and have tried so many different pork rinds, scratchings, etc but have yet to come across an authentically British version of these. The Mexican ones are close but still not the same. I'm so happy to have finally found some here on Amazon.Mr. Porky Pork Scratchings are the real deal!! Crunchy on the outside, chewy/soft inside and filled with lots of flavor. They are a tad on the salty side but they make for an excellent every-now-and-then snack.I told my dad about them and he's happily looking forward to me shipping some to him soon.I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a quality pork scratching. Whether you have memories from the UK or have never tried them and would like to give it a go, this is the brand I would recommend."

The quality of the chips is good, however the “salted egg” coating wasn’t that great.One of the main ingredient is powdered milk and the taste is quite obvious and it is not as good as salted egg. Quite powdery. The coating is too thick yet the flavor is not the best. For a little bit more coins, get the higher quality brand.This is just acceptable."

Why would anyone pay more than twice as much as 6 of them would cost in the store? Convenience isn't worth that :/  I really wish I lived closer to Trader Joe's, but I still won't pay this much for wasabi seaweed. Why not just make it a 12 pack for the same price? It's not like the weight would cost shipping prices to go up. You could balance a box of 12 packs on your fingertips no problem lol. Quite a shame :/"
3346,Ms. Storm,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2019",Price is a bit too steep for me,"  These are a great snack. Packed with flavor. Some can have more kick of spice then you expect but overall are pretty darn good. However, they literally cost .99 cents at Trader Joe's. You're paying $15 for a six pack plus shipping and handling. For that amount you can buy an entire box (I believe it's 12 inside a box) at the store and still have money left over. Not worth buying online buy definitely worth buying."
3347,Sleepless Dreamer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2017",Love them but they have sugar.,"  We love them, they are great with rice and avocado or with stir fry veg. My kids like the original better.If you don't finish the pack it gets too damp and it's not crispy anymore.  And so you have to eat it all, even when I put it in a seal bag still not the same.And they have sugar. So I guess I keep to kelp"
3348,LC,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2012",If heaven came in a bag...,"  It would be called Trader Joe's Roasted Seaweed Snack.These dried pieces of seaweed are lightly coated in sesame oil and salt for a crisp, delicious snack. I'd never tried roasted seaweed before but I decided to give them a try. Needless to say, I now consider myself a seaweed addict.Seaweed has many healthy things in it that we most likely don't get from other sources of food we eat. The best thing about this snack is that you can eat the whole bag (and trust me, you will) and it's only 60 calories.You will pay a lot lower price if you buy it in the store rather than from Amazon. Not everyone has a local store to them so at least you have somewhere to buy this yummy treat!"
3349,SistaBNYC,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2012",Love this!,"  I only tried these a few weeks ago (they're 99 cents at Trader Joe's for a packet of about 20 pieces) and I think they're the perfect snack. At only 60 calories for the whole thing, you can't beat it for a quick salty treat. I fold one piece into 4 sections and pop it in. Since it has a wasabi seasoning on it, at first taste you think ""Oh my God, what have I done"", but the heat only lasts for about 3 seconds and then the flavor sets in. You really do have to get these by the 10 pack cause you can easily scarf down 2 boxes without even thinking about it."
3350,asims,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2012",ADDICTED!,"  I've been addicted to these lately, even got some odd stares one day when I cleared the whole shelf of these little bags into my cart at Trader Joes. Its the prefect thing to fight a mid afternoon craving while still having tons of flavor. I tried Annie Chungs once and was amazed how bland they were compared to these."
3351,cricket62,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2013",Another addict!,  This is like methadone for sushi addicts - but it is also very addicting!  I buy it by a case of 40 from Trader Joe's every couple of weeks. I've tried two other brands of wasabi seaweed snacks and Trader Joe's is by far superior (and cheaper...at the store).
3352,Penny Gname,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2013",Great Nori flavor,"  I like this, but it is a pretty hefty kick from the wasabi. Maybe because I eat it driving home from Trader Joe's and don't rest my mouth between. I like the other, non-wasabi, variety a bit better.If you don't like nori, or don't eat sushi, then you might not care for this. Nori tastes like the ocean. Salty, a bit of fish flavor... I love it. The roasted nori is awesome. It's like almost calorie free potato chips."
3353,Gary Peterson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2012",You Gotta Try One!,"  Here's a snack you gotta try.

Interesting product!Gary Peterson"
3354,Wazzapova,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2014",Addicted! Jeepers Creepers!,"  My coworker brought these in to the office recently, and after sampling it, I fell in love. I went to the local West Hartford, CT location and bought 5 of the Wasabi flavor. I am going back today to buy whatever is left on the shelf! If you love sushi, you will love these. The Wasabi flavor isn't overbearing for my taste as I adore Asian cuisine of all kinds. I have kicked a LOT of bad habits including being a problem gambler (2 years next week ;) , but I don't know if I can stop eating these!!!"
3355,MajorMajorMajor,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2012",Very Delish and Only 30 calories!,  I was hesitant to try but I figured what the heck worth a try and I was very glad I did. They are crispy with lots of salty wasabi flavor. Does not have a fishy flavor which is what I was afraid would happen. A whole package has only 60 total calories (2 servings.) Really a yummy treat.

3356,Megan C.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2015",Sugar in the Seaweed,"  I LOVE their seaweed, but I've been trying to decipher lately where my hidden sugar consumption has been coming from. Here is one blindsiding culprit. The wasabi one specifically has sugar listed on the ingredient list. I was SO DISAPPOINTED. Now I buy the regular in lieu of a sugar-laced product. READ the labels on your food as sugar hides under several aliases (including terms like corn syrup solids and brown rice syrup)."
3357,mediamst,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2012",Excellent! Love them,"  If you like roasted seaweed and wasabi you will love these.

The seaweed tasted like old dried up fish and the wasabi burned my mouth and nose. I pushed through several more bites, read the nutrition facts, and now love this tasty snack.

Allen,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2012",Like licking a dirty fish tank,"  My wife bought these for me because she knows I love wasabi and will eat just about anything coated with it.  There was almost no wasabi taste to the two chips I tried (I threw the rest out).  The only taste I got was a strong nasty ""fishy"" taste.  Now I'm not one of those nuts who orders fish in a restaurant and then complains about it tasting like fish (gasp).  These tasted like fish that is spoiled, hence my title.  Two cans of diet pepsi and I can't get the awful taste off of my poor tongue.  On the plus side, the guys at work got a good laugh out of my misfortune."
3365,Will,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2013","Tasty, but overpackaged","  Seaweed snacks are a great alternative to chips and other less healthy snacks, and I concur with the positive taste ratings others have given here.  The main reason I cannot give these a 5 star rating is the excessive foil and plastic packaging, it seems there is a better way to offer these, either in bulk quantities or in recycled non-plastic based material."

I love the fact that I've replaced chips with seaweed snacks, as they are much healthier, and yet I hardly notice the difference because the flavor of these is so great. My only complaint is that these are pretty expensive and so I don't buy them regularly. Instead, I will typically buy the Kirkland brand seaweed because they give you a lot more for your money. The downside there is that they don't have Chipotle flavors like this, but I'm willing to dip them in my own hot sauce to accomplish that aim.Highly recommend any type of seaweed snack as a healthier alternative to chips & other traditional junk food..."

The chipotle does have a pretty good kick to it, so if you don't like spicy this might not be the one for you. I also really like the onion flavor.

It arrived almost exactly (2 days less) than a month after purchase. The contents were varied and closely resembled what I had expected (from product pictures). There was an expiration date guide included. One item (one of the sticks in the top right of my photo) expired 2 days after arrival, so we ate that first (it was tasty). A few expire towards the end of this month, and the rest seem to expire around about 3 months from arrival with an outlier here or there. I haven't eaten all of them yet, but I will say from looking and being the type of person who has ordered quite a few of these Japanese candy/snack boxes that this isn't for the type of person who only wants to eat stereotypical American type of candy.

I'm Japanese and miss Japanese snacks but I live in a place where no one sells it nearby, so I'm glad such a thing like this exists. It's neatly packaged in a box and nothing appears to be cracked or smashed, and I'm actually quite happy with the fact some flavors are randomized! I will warn however that most of this isn't the popular Japanese food like Pocky, so if you're not used to the taste of Japanese snacks I recommend a package that has more conventional brands before moving onto packages like these. Finally, there's no English description in the box (at least for mine) for the flavors and ingredients, so keep that in mind if that would be an issue!"

3569,Mercury & Garrett,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2015",great seller! So I like most of the colors,"  I ordered my pack from Kolorize Me whom I also reviewed, great seller! So I like most of the colors. The metallics are gorgeous but not what I was expecting. They're not quite what I personally would call metallic. More like a very heavy pearl. Still gorgeous! But I'll have to look elsewhere for the perfect metallic polish. The neons are gorgeous and CRAZY BRIGHT! Not quite neon but the next tier of obnoxiously bright. The pastels are perfect! They remind me of Easter lol. The only one I didn't like that much was the purple. Well, I like it but I think it's too dark for pastel (very pale skin here). I also got the holo polishes that KC makes. I really love Chunky Holo Black the best (I think everyone does). The formula for these polishes doesn't really seem to be incredibly consistent. I played around with about 30 different colors already and can see that some of the polishes apply REALLY well and others don't. Meaning, some I could apply one coat and get away with. Others, I gave up at 3. The obvious ones are the holos, I know that already. But others like Neon Lime, Funky Yellow and Sheer Lilac were still pretty see through. For the purposes I need them for (Stamping and nail art), I'll have to mess around with each color individually to get a feel for it or else I wind up with splotchy nails that look like a mess. For the price you pay on this particular pack, it's a killer deal. I'd definitely recommend it for someone who is looking into playing around with a lot of color or is maybe a novice. The price = many chances to mess up and not worry. But if you're used to QUALITY nail polish, I'd steer clear of this. I attached a photo , please ignore the 6 in the middle and the lip gloss. Those aren't part of this review. :)"

We each paid $20 then whenever the order came she picked one, i picked one until we went through the bottles. Many of the colors in this collection are very pretty!!! It also comes with qa few matte polishes.. I thought this was going to be a clear matte top coat to many any polish have a matte finish. Actually the colors themself turn matte. I believe there is a black one and then a shimmery magenta one.. it turns out nice because its shimmery, yet flat bc of the matte. The colors go on nice and dont take too long to dry. Dont get me wrong, these are not Essie polishes, but they do the job if you want to add to your collection without spending $10/bottle."

Most colors give great coverage and have great pigment but I find some of the colors so sheer that approx 4+ coats are needed (garnet red, sheer pastels). If you do stamping, some of these polishes will not work for you. Polishes don't have to horrible of a smell. Kleancolor polishes have great no chipping life spans for me (I'm pretty rough on my hands).  Would recommend and purchase again."

Kleancolor is a brand that I use almost exclusively. Mostly because I change my polish almost daily and it would be a serious waste to do that with a $10 bottle of polish.The colors I received were beautifuil and I only received one repeat, which is fine by me because it was a very pretty color that my daughter started eyeing as soon as it came out of the box, so I just gave her the extra one. ;)The polishes came with not a single broken or cracked bottle. They were packaged in small boxes 6 to a box with a cardboard separator and a layer of bubble wrap to make it tight. The large box was the perfect size for the small boxes so there was no rattling around.I painted my nails last night the beautiful metalic red color. I love it. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking to be able to paint their nails in a variety of colors, frequently. I can't speak to the longevity of the polish as I change almost daily. But I definitely love the Kleancolor brand."

Only one of the polishes had a problem but it wasn't because of the shipping, the pink metallic color kind of exploded from being out in the heat because i was at work when the package arrived. There is still plenty of the polish left in the bottle though and its a color I probably won't use that often. I am extremely happy and they stamp well and apply nicely."

They are an amazing snack and very very tasty! So; why? a 1 star harsh review???Easy. EVERY time I order (generally 3-4 boxes at a time) there a box or 2 that are literally crumbs! LITERALLY! Just broken assed crumbs. I actually think Amazon has a cracker (and cereal too) shake and break machine. its absolutely ridiculous! So much that I simply cannot buy them anymore (or bread, or cereal, or any type of chip or cracker, they don't discriminate) from Amazon and just need to pay more and buy them retail to get a decent box of unbroken crackers.Lame."

3620,Gloria,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2018",A great snack for vegans,  These crackers are healthier than any other crackers I have found.

3621,berdie1951,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2020","Great, but ...","  I have received 3 boxes, one monthly, with Subscribe & Save.  I would have given 5 stars, and this may be due to Amazon's packing, but about half of the crackers are broken into pieces that are so small you can only eat them with your fingers.  You cannot scoop dip or spread hummus on them because they are so small.  A good part of the pieces are so small they are actually crumbs.  It is really a shame because the crackers that survived the shipping are thin, very crispy and tasty.  I used to buy Mary's crackers from Costco, and the product was never as pulverized as the 3 boxes I have received.  The S&S price is really good, but not for crumbs.  I will be canceling further orders."
3622,Seek Felicity,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2017",Some crackers broken but flavor is good,"  I had never seen these crackers before in the store, but they seemed like a slightly healthier alternative to saltines.  My kiddo loves crackers right now, and I thought I'd give these a go.  The box arrived in tact, but there were quite a few crackers inside that were broken in half -- still very edible but not as convenient a size.  The flavor is good, and I will see if I can find them in my local stores for more regular purchasing."
3623,Moon,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2020",GROSS! Maybe burnt?,"  I got these because I had previously purchased the Mary's Gone Super Seed Classic crackers - and they were AMAZING. These EVERYTHING ones are DISGUSTING. They taste bitter and burnt. I took a picture of the CLASSIC next to the EVERYTHING and the everything cracker is much smaller in size, which leads me to believe they're burnt. Anyway... I'll be avoiding these and getting the Classic instead (but how disappointing that there is no quality control!)."
3624,RiverOfMay,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2020",ADDICTIVE...,"  I tried these on a whim b/c I went gluten-free. Choices in our market are limited. I saw these and immediately ordered the Black Pepper cracker. O.M.G. They are delicious! Snappy, super-crisp, just unique! The carb load isn't bad if you munch 'em in moderation. They are great with low-fat cream cheese, topped with various veggie slices, including carrot, cucumber, radish, and on and on. A tad of hot pepper jelly is wicked good! Highly recommend! Just wish they were less expensive."
3625,SaraShopper,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2019",Healthy nutty taste with a crunch,"  I've tried out 30 different cracker brands when we set out to find non white flour crackers. Mary's crackers have consistently stayed #1 in our family. You have to chew a little longer than most because - well, its all seeds! But they make this cracker very nutty and flavorful and plenty of that crunch when you crave crunchy.I just wish there was a way this brand could bring the price down. We would buy them much more often and so would all those who we told to get some. Each one complained about price but all loved the taste.  Would give this a 5 star if closer to $4 than $5"
3626,LS,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 7, 2019",Mostly crumbs,"  I bought 2 boxes and they came in the corrugated Amazon box. When I went to try them, they were packed just in thick cellophane in the manufacturer’s box, and they were mostly crumbs! The other box was the same...broken crackers and mostly crumbs. I tried them anyway. The taste is okay, a little salty though. At the same time I ordered Back to Nature Multigrain Seeded Flatbread. That company packed the crackers better in the box. They were no broken and tasted much better."
3627,Brittany,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2018",Delicious and Healthy,"  I was recommended these crackers as a substitute for crackers and other vehicles for dips. I love homemade guacamole, and I was tired of using veggies as my dippers. (I'm on a Paleo-Keto diet) These seed crackers were the perfect solution. This flavor is 'everything,' so think of it as an everything bagel with extra onion. They did the trick! But I would like to try the original next to see the taste difference."

These GLUTEN FREE crackers are full of the best taste ever!!

This is about my 5th purchase of these crackers."
3629,elena j,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2020",Full of healthy seeds,"  These Mary's Gone Crackers Super Seed organic crackers are a perfect accompaniment to soups, chili and salads.

3631,Samantha,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 27, 2020",Good tasting.,  I like that these crackers have clean ingredients.  They do have a good taste to them.  But for me they left a little after taste I didn’t like that much.  They might be better with something on them than plain.  But still not bad for a cracker with clean ingredients.  And not weird stuff you can’t pronounce.  I would recommend them.
3632,Texas,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2019",Packaging was great!,"  Packaging was great as crackers seem to get damaged in shipping but these stayed in tact.  I'm on keto diet and wanted to use these as a substitution for 'chips & dip'.  Broke apart pretty easily in dip so ended up scooping broken chips out of dip with a spoon. Also had a little bit of an off flavor--very ""seed-y"".  Glad I tried them but probably wouldnt purchase a second time."
3633,Selena Hall,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2020",Ok snack but little flavor,  I bought those since I am on a diet and wanted a snack that is not full of calories and something I can eat between my hunger attacks. I like the product as far as the nutrition guidelines and what it is made of but it tastes bland to me. I think a little seasoning would have helped the taste.

3638,Karen,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2018",Great but a bit too crunchy,  I bought a box of the Everything variety on a whim. Glad I did.  I wanted a cracker that wasn’t sweet like almost every other cracker on the market. They had lots of tasty seeds and a hint of garlic.  About 1/4 of the crackers were broken. I used those as salad topping. Really my only complaint is that they are super hard and absolutely not for anyone who has sensitive teeth.

Good with a soft cheese or hummus as they are fragile.I knocked off a star because about 1/2 of each small bag is burnt, and that turns them a bit bitter.You can cope with it with some sort of dip, but far nicer if they were baked in a consistent way."
3643,Cat Owner 6804,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2019",Crunchy cracker,"  To be honest I just left this at the pantry for a while until someone opened it.

3827,Raynebow Ocean,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2018",Burnt. Worst Tasting Crackers,"  I’ve tried this and the original seed variety. Read on about my negative experience with both:I have purchased at least ten+ boxes from Sprouts. They had a burnt flavor indicating they were left in the oven too long. I emailed the company to let them know. They said they’d send me coupons and never did. I followed up saying I hadn’t received them and they said sure we’ll send them off. Three weeks later nothing. I found good seed crackers at Trader Joe’s which don’t cost almost $6 a box and without concern of eating burnt crackers. I can’t believe I query in politely to let them know and they led me on, hence my decision to write a review. Seriously, without any exaggeration these are the worst crackers I’ve ever had the displeasure of tasting."
3828,Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2020",No problem with crushed crackers; but you better LOVE burnt onion,  I so wanted to love these. I just don't. No problem like others with crushed cracker delivery; my issue was all about the flavor. Burnt and oppressive onion is not Everything. The regular seed ones are great.
3829,Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 8, 2018",on Marry's Super Seed Crackers,"  I broke a tooth, badly, on Marry's Super Seed Crackers.  I called the company and it was impossible to even get through to a representative.  I called three times, having to leave messages.  After three weeks, no one has called me back.  There was some sort of  very hard ""seed""  -- which could have been small stone or gravel -- in the seed when I bit down.  I now have to get a crown.  I'll never buy these crackers again.  The company is irresponsible as well, never having the courtesy to call me back.  This is a very lame company with a high-risk product."
3830,Hey Tracy,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2018",Ick!,  I did not like these crackers at all!  I usually love seedy grainy things but these were hard to chew and the taste was just not that nice.  Very disappointed and would not order again.

3832,Christopher Kosel,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 12, 2019",Disappointingly high volume of broken product,"  The taste of these crackers is really quite good, but quality control is poor, and you're as likely as not to get a LOT of broken crackers in your box. It is hard to put cheese, dip, anchovies, etc. on broken/fragmented crackers. Not good."

3835,MSHA,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2017",Offensive bitter taste and a waste of great ingredients,"  Burnt, burnt, burnt. Offensive bitter taste and a waste of great ingredients. Should never have made it off the packaging line."
3836,DeborahDarling,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2017",Great cracker - but this price is way too high,  These crackers : Super Seed EVERYTHING have just 15 net carbs in 12 crackers. I buy them to help keep my MIL's blood sugar under control. They are wonderful with a low carb spread or by themselves. We go through 1 or 2 boxes a week. I buy them for $5.50 per 5.5 oz box at my local Sprouts. The cracker deserves a 5 star rating but the price is almost double what it should be!

Delivered very crisp and have held up well after opening. Almost full bag is pieces that are 1/2 a cracker or more (mostly unbroken). The nutritional values on this product make it guilt free.
