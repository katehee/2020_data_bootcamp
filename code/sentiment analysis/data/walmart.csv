5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Linda M.,",14-Jan-20,These seaweed snacks that I have tasted were delicious. I purchased the sea salt flavor and they left me wanting more.

5,Iâm hooked!,"Cherlyn,",13-Mar-20,"seen other people buying it. Thought I would try it. First package was surprising! I was surprised by the thinness. Then the slight fishy taste instead of a plant taste was a surprise. Itâs from the sea, naturally, as my son pointed out. But by the time I bought the next two packages, I was hooked! The bit of saltiness and the crunch... yum!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Chrystal A.,",08-Mar-20,My son loves seaweed but I want to be sure it's good quality. I bought the original sea salt it was a hit!

4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Melissa M.,",27-Dec-19,Ocean's Halo seaweed snacks are great snacks to take on the go or relaxing at home. The small package servings are perfect size.

4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Vu L.,",11-Feb-20,"the chili lime is fantastic. it had a great flavor and was very crisp. my only complaint would be that the package seemed lacking. especially given that these are particularly thin, i will need more in the pack to satisfy my snacking!

3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Christina K.,",26-Dec-19,"I thought these seaweed snacks were okay; though a little salty for me. i would perhaps purchase another flavor, but not the seasalt again. Besides the saltiness, the seaweed itself tasted interesting. Very unique snack. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Katie P.,",02-Mar-20,"This is a high-quality organic products with good ingredients. I liked that it has a little crisp to it, but it is just too chewy for me after the first crisp. If I'm going to have to gnaw on leaves for a while, if rather just eat a salad. I tried the sea salt, so maybe the other options would have a little more flavor that would make a difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Megan M.,",16-Dec-19,"Well....I was very excited to try some of these products because I LOVE Asian food. Today I purchased the seaweed snacks and the ramen bowl. I was very eager to try it so I ripped it open as soon as I got into the car and put a piece into my mouth......And then I almost threw up immediately. I hate to sound dramatic but it's true. I'm not 100% sure if it was a texture thing or an actual taste thing but it was awful!! It took EVERYTHING in my power to not throw up in my car. I had to dig in my center console for a piece of gum to help get the taste out of my mouth. I am still looking forward to trying other products in this line, but the seaweed snacks are definitely not for me. I also purchased the wasabi flavor but I am TERRIFIED to try it.

4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Paige P.,",10-Jan-20,"I did enjoy this snack in the afternoon after lunch. I do like the flavor, but does taste a little dry.

5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Carrie S.,",23-Jan-20,"What a great snack! I loved the flavors and texture of the seaweed snacks. Although the bacon flavor wasn't my favorite, it wasn't terrible and I still enjoyed the snack. My favorite flavor was the sea salt. It had a perfect seasoning of sea salt and the perfect crunch and not overwhelming taste of fishy flavor. I love how thin the snack sheets are as well. Overall I was very happy with this snack and have purchased several times since trying my free sample. I'm a fan! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Tracy C.,",10-Feb-20,I never actually tried seaweed before. To my surprise I liked it but the most appealing aspect was I felt like I was doing my body a favor when eating it. I definitely will buy it. I love finding things that are convenient to snack on and good for you. My kids are tough and because of how it looked refused to have anything to do with it. My one suggestion would be if you could alter the color to make it more appealing to children. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Kari D.,",04-Feb-20,"I received the sea salt organic seaweed snacks. My girls love seaweed snacks and these were such a positive experience for them to try this brand by Ocean's Halo. I really appreciate that they are non-GMO as well. My girls eat these just as they are out of the package. I had mentioned the other flavors to them and they are interested in trying them all. They really enjoyed the taste of the sea salt and didn't feel as if these snacks were over salted and that had a nice crunch to them and tasted very fresh.

3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Nicolette W.,",22-Dec-19,"I normally purchase another brand of seaweed snacks and was very open to trying another brand. I tried the sea salt kind since that is the kind I get when I but the other brand I normally eat. I found Halo's Ocean to be too salty for my liking and I could not even eat an entire pack. They had the same overall flavor, but extremely salty. I would only get them if I had a coupon or they are out of my normal brand, even though they are cheaper.

5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jeneen R.,",26-Jan-20,"I tried the Wasabi, Sriracha, Korean BBQ and Maui Onion flavors. I tried them with my daughter and we both enjoyed all four varieties. My favorite was the Sriracha and next, the Korean BBQ. I tend to like spicy and sweet flavors together and those flavors really nailed it for me. My daughter's favorite was the Maui Onion flavor. She always enjoys a good onion flavor and these snacks definitely delivered the perfect amount. We both liked that there was plenty of seasoning on all of the flavors and that the seaweed sheets were nice and crunchy and fresh tasting. I would definitely recommend these to anyone who enjoys seaweed snacks. I would love it even more if there were more per individual package because they were gone so fast!

4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jamie S.,",27-Dec-19,"This is a great product!! My 8-year-old absolutely loves the seaweed snacks. So much healthier than chips or sugar-based products. The came right away after I signed up. So the customer service rating is 5 stars so far!! When I opened the package I did not get the bombardment of the seaweed smell... It was very subtle. I didn't try them myself, but my little girl enjoyed them. We opted for the regular Sea Salt variety which is her favorite. I would be interested in buying other flavors to broaden her range a bit.

3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Stefanie P.,",08-Jan-20,Me and my family tried the sea salt flavor of the Organic Seaweed Snacks. It was definitely something different and something we were a bit nervoys to try however it wasnt that bad. It was a bit too salty though. My sons didnt really like them and I dont believe they would be very filling for growing childrwn.

4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Susan H.,",02-Dec-19,This is a great healthy snack if you feel like snacking. It won't fill you up but you won't feel as guilty as after eating a bag of chips. They are thin sheets and crunchy when you bite. The seasoning was nice and I can taste the spice of Wasabi. It gives you a nice change from other snacks. The smell probably takes time to get used if you never had seaweed like that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Vanessa M.,",14-Nov-19,So ill personally never buy this product again the after taste was horrible it went down easy.

5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Tian J.,",03-Dec-19,"Taste really good. Crispy and not too salty.Seaweed might not be the first thing that comes to mind when we think of healthy snacks, but it's actually a delicious, low-cal way to add a boost of nutrients to your day. It's packed with important vitamins and minerals such as iodine, calcium, iron, magnesium, zinc, and vitamins A and C. When you buy it in stores, you'll most often find dried seaweed (usually the nori variety, which is the kind used to wrap sushi) sold in sheets, flakes, or handy snack packs. Fresh seaweed, on the other hand, is commonly sold as an ingredient in prepared foods like sushi or seaweed salad. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Ashlie H.,",08-Dec-19,I thought the Ocean's Halo seaweed snack was okay. To me it tasted like greens but a lot more salty. It is a lot thinner that I thought it would be. It's a good snack but it's just not for me. I could eat it on occasion but it wouldn't be my first choice. I think it's an acquired taste. It would be a nice healthy snack for someone who loves seaweed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Gabriella I.,",25-Nov-19,"I couldn't decide what to do for dinner, and when I spotted the row of Ocean's Halo broths in my grocer's soup aisle I knew I had to give one a try. After some deliberation, (and input from the kids) I went with the Thai coconut flavor. I also picked up a box of Ocean's Halo rice noodles, chicken and some veggies to make soup.When I opened the carton and took a whiff I was met with the scents of thai spices and brine. It reminded me of my favorite thai restaurant. Following the instructions on the box, it took me less than ten minutes to throw together a delicious soup--the perfect meal for a frigid late fall evening. My entire family loved the taste, including my picky 6 year old. Win!I am looking forward to trying the other flavors of broth that Oceans Halo offers, as well as some of their other products.

It has now become my ten childrens, my husbands, and I new snack choice! Finally i do not have to fight with them to eat something that is healthy!"
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jonnah D.,",11-Dec-18,"I only rated four stars because I didn't think there was anything special that stood out with the taste of these seaweed snacks. I feel like it tasted the same as most other seaweed snacks store-brand or private-label seaweeds. Yes, we liked it (my 15 month old likes it too!) and yes we will buy it but there was nothing special about it. Thank you very much for the opportunity, Ocean's Halo and Social Nature! #trynatural #gotitfree"
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Carline O.,",29-Oct-18,"The chili lime seaweed snacks were definitely a first for me. I didn't quite know what to expect. It has an interesting flavor to it, but not in a bad way. I liked trying it out, but I think I would have to eat a few more to get accustomed to the flavor."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Meghan T.,",20-Nov-18,These were delicious! I stuck with plain Sea Salt and honestly I cant compare the flavor to anything Ive had before but these are so good! I shared them with my kids and didnt tell them what it was and they loved it! I love this healthy alternative to the salty snacks I usually indulge in!
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Courtney S.,",19-Nov-18,I tried Oceans Halo Organic Seaweed Snacks and they were pretty good. I've never really had seaweed before but I feel like the Korean BBQ flavor did a good job masking any weird seaweed taste. I enjoyed the crunch it did make for a good quick on the go snack. My kids did not like them at all. I enjoyed them. Will probably try the chili lime flavor and bacon using one of the coupons I also received. 6 buy one get one free thank you!!! Distantly getting some noodle bowls !! #trynatural
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Tracy W.,",28-Nov-18,"I was given an opportunity to try Organic Seaweed Snacks through Social Nature in exchange for my honest review. I haven't tried many of the organic products on the market. The snacks were not too bad. I tried the Sea Salt flavor. It had a nice, salty taste but not too salty. The texture was a little bit of a problem for me. I felt like I was eating seaweed lol. But that could of been all in my head. I'm particular about texture so it may not be a problem for others. The seaweed is ocean-farmed and I liked that it is sustainable and that the company cares about that."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Dan K.,",20-Nov-18,"I tried a sample of the bacon flavored seaweed snacks. I was really impressed with the bold flavor and the quality of the snacks themselves. They didn't disintegrate after one bite like many similar snacks do. They come in a perfect size for sharing or, like I did, eat the entire thing yourself."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Lisa W.,",03-Dec-18,I thought it was pretty good once I got over the idea it was made from seaweed. I had never tried seaweed before and didn't have any idea of what to expect. I thought it would taste fishy like because it was from the sea; I was definitely way off base. It was not fishy at all and the bacon flavor was delicious wouldn't even know it was from seaweed aside from reading it on the packaging. Will definitely try other flavors and buy the bacon again. Thanks a lot!
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Dawn C.,",10-Dec-18,"The sea salt are delicious and taste great. They are a great healthy snack alternative. Easy to take with you on the go. They are my go to snack during that ""afternoon lull"" in work! The best part is every packaged purchased, they help keep the ocean clean!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jennifer S.,",24-Nov-18,I loved Ocean's Halo seaweed snack. It has great flavor and is so crispy. I love the fact that it is organic and is made with very few ingredients. I can't wait to try all of the flavors. My daughters love it as well. Now everytime we visit the store they ask for the seaweed snacks. We tried the sea salt and bbq. They were both delicious. It is a tasty and affordable snack that I am more than happy to purchase for my family.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Deb K.,",11-Nov-18,I was surprised how good Oceans Halo sea salt seaweed snacks tasted. I did not know what to expect. I ate it for lunch with my sandwich. I recommend that you try it. I would also eat it as a snack during break time or as a grab and go snack on a busy day. I got a free sample but this is my own opinion.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Linda C.,",11-Mar-19,"I tried the Ocean's Halo seaweed snack chili lime flavor. I really enjoyed the flavor, it was tangy and spicy but not too spicy. I would definitely buy again and would recommend it to friends and family. I'm looking forward to trying the other flavors."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Joann L.,",07-Dec-18,"I like seaweed snacks espeically to add to ramen. I definitely like the korean bbq flavor b/c I am a fan of korean bbq. I wish it comes in smaller packs than this since I dont want it to get stale once I opened it. Other than that, I enjoyed halo snack very much"
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Dee K.,",19-Dec-18,"It's the first time I tried seaweed snacks and my family and I loved it. We tried the chili lime and sea salt. It's little expensive but since it was a buy1get1 free from social nature, the price didn't seem a problem. The taste and ingredients(amount of salt) was perfect. Looking forward to trying different recipes with seaweed snacks posted on Pinterest."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Chelsey R.,",24-Jan-19,We all got together and went to the store used one coupon per pay card and coupon match up went home and made a big meal with all of it at one location like a holiday the family had such a special trip and the food prep was easy and my highly allergic to soy and gluten mother who has fought cancer had zero bad reactions and had a great time with her grand children and children and sons. Thank you so much for the packet of cupons!
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Rosaura R.,",05-Dec-18,Ocean's Halo seaweed snack are something else. I tried the sea salt flavor and found it to be quite tasty. The seaweed sheet is a thin and healthy alternative to chips and I don't have to share since my kids are not willing to try them. I would definitely have them again.
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Rachel R.,",16-Nov-18,"I've always been a fan of seaweed snacks, but for some reason I have a propensity to get heartburn after eating them.. Anyways, I tried the sea salt flavor and I found it to be pretty comparable to other snack-sized seaweed products on the market. A little salty to give it some flavor, but not too overpowering. I'm not sure what it was about the ocean's halo version though, but this time I didn't get heartburn! I will be a repeat customer if nothing else for that!"
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Marianne T.,",25-Feb-19,Very tasty product. Will advise others to try. Many different flavors to try......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Alexa O.,",17-Jan-19,"Absolutely delicious. In the past, ive tried seaweed snacks that are too salty or not flavored at all however I love the variety and flavors ocean halo provides. I made it with miso ramen and my husband and I loved it. I will definetely be buying more in the future."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jenny T.,",07-Dec-18,"I really liked this seaweed! I tried the sea salt one,I love eating this seaweed as a snack or with rice and some kind of meat. This particular brand bad just the right seasoning to it. It was delicious and would definitely recommend this product to friends and family"
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Julia K.,",25-Nov-18,"The Seaweed Snacks where really delicious! The taste ""Wasabi"" is really spicey but still good. It gives the whole thing a great kick. Also the consistency is really nice. It is really crispy and not mushy at all. Eating it you can feel, that you are eating a really healthy snack that still satisfies you."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Allison P.,",07-Dec-18,I received my free sample of oceans Halo organic seaweed snacks from#social nature I got the wasabi flavor and sea salt flavor I bought oceans Halo noodle bowls to an put everything together it was really good I definitely will recommend this to people an will buy again
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Peggy M.,",31-Oct-18,"I was honestly prepared not to like this product, but wow I was surprised. I got the Chili Lime and I loved it. I love when I try a snack food that is not only good for me, but tastes good as well. The flavor is just perfect and not overwhelming. The seaweed crisps are a very good texture which I thoroughly enjoyed. I will definitely be picking up some of the other flavors. Even the kids liked them. This is the perfect healthy snack!"
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Heather F.,",25-Nov-18,"I didn't really enjoy these. I got the sea salt variety but the overall flavor just wasn't for me. It left a weird after taste. I didn't enjoy the texture either. I'm looking forward to trying other products from this brand, however. This one just wasn't for me. #GotItFree"
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Marleise B.,",12-Jan-19,Seaweed snacks are such a unique and different healthy snack. My kids tried them as well and we all loved them! We had the wasabi and they are delightfully spicy but not too spicy for the younger snackers! What a great addition to the lunchbox!!! I highly recommend this product!
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Melissa T.,",04-Nov-18,"I couldn't find the seaweed snacks, but I got the ramen bowl which was pretty cool. All you need is a microwave to heat it all up. It comes with its own biodegradable bowl, broth, ramen and spices. I made it for my daughter since she loves ramen but I don't find most of them too healthy. She was ok with it. It says to heat it for 2-3 minutes but it's not quite long enough as the noodles were still a bit hard. Taste is great though."
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Kat G.,",25-Nov-18,I was intrigued when i opened the package. Ive has sushi before so i knew I liked seaweed. I thought i would like the crunchy texture and i did. But I didnt like the flavor at all. I had the seaweed one and it just tasted like sour salty green stuff. I wouldn't buy it again. I just didn't care for the flavor.
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Hope A.,",06-Dec-18,Got the opportunity to try one of these products totally free in return for my honest review about my experience. Considering the many choices it was hard to pick just one but I did the Texas bbq. Let me say these were no where near what I thought they would be. The taste was great any even got me reconsider the brand I've been choosing and begin purchasing this one.
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"nic S.,",15-Nov-18,I received this product via Free coupon in exchange for my honest review from social nature. While I was very excited to try this product I wasn't very pleased with its taste. I choose the sea salt flavor because I thought it was safe. I am not a huge sea food fan; in fact most sea food makes me sick to my stomach. This smelled salty and tasted like salted algae(sp). I actually had to run to the trash can after kinda chewing it because I almost threw up in my mouth. If you like fish or shrimp you'll probably like this but its not for me. I'd still like to give some of their other products a try but I will never touch seaweed again. LOL
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Ruthelle L.,",13-Jan-19,"I got the sea salt organic seaweed snacks. The seaweed sheets are very thin. I tried one by just eating it by itself. I was not very fond of the taste or aftertaste. So I decided to give it another try and had some with white rice. This taste was much better when I had it wrapped around the rice. However, the aftertaste still wasn't pleasant for me. So sadly I wouldn't purchase this specific product again because I didn't like the lingering aftertaste."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Amy C.,",06-Dec-18,I was skeptical of organic sea weed snacks at first thinking they would taste gross. To my surprise they were delcious and more filling than I thought they would be. They had a nice light airy crispy texture. The flavor did not overpower the seaweed flavor. I would buy these again and again! They are delcious and healthy.
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Kassi S.,",12-Jan-19,"I would never think of trying seaweed as a snack as I have tried it on sushi and didn't care for it. I was pleasantly surprised that it didn't have a seaweed taste at all and was a light, crunchy, slightly salty treat that is a nice healthy replacement for potato chips. Even my 10 year old loved them and asked me to buy more!"
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Alex K.,",28-Nov-18,"I tried the korean barbecue, I've never had korean barbeque but I've had seaweed chips before, these were quite good! Make me want to try korean barbecue! I love that they're non-GMO and sustainably farmed. Even my 3 year old likes them! Will buy again!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Manon W.,",11-Mar-19,"I picked the onion because I wanted to sample something outside of the ""normal"" seaweed snack flavors (wasabi, sea salt) without trying one of the more unusual flavor options. I loved it. The seaweed was crisp and crunchy and had just the perfect kiss of onion flavor. I will be trying these again."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Emma J.,",07-Feb-19,"When I first saw this product I was a little sceptical since seaweed is not something that I normally eat. I was pleasantly surprised with how good it was. I tried the lightly salted one, it was good but didn't have much flavor. Obviously. However I am really looking forward to trying more now that I have gotten my feet wet."
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Karen M.,",11-Nov-18,"I tried the Ocean's Halo Organic Seaweed Snacks Sea Salt flavor and was not impressed. First, they are see- through thin and they're a size that is too big to fit the whole sheet in your mouth, but when you try to just bite a piece off or fold it in half they break and crumble. And I'm not a fan of seafood at all so maybe that's why I didn't like the taste or smell. Maybe a stronger flavor like wasabi or sriracha would mask the sea smell better and make them more edible to me."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"juslin F.,",07-Jan-19,Oceans Halo seaweed is a truly awesome snack. I take it with me for lunch and its the right fill me up duting the day. Not salty but has that right amount of salt that i look for in my snacks. I have been trying different flavors and simply love them all.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Katie T.,",18-Nov-18,The Oceans Halo organic seaweed snacks were great! I tried the wasabi organic seaweed snacks that give you a hint of spice and amazing bold flavors that will satisfy any food craving! I would definitely recommend these to anyone that wants to have a spicy kick for their snack!
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Samantha G.,",28-Jan-19,"I was absolutely not the audience for these seaweed things. I put one in my mouth and it got stuck to my tongue like a Listerine strip and I couldn't get it out. It was gross. I gave my remaining product to a co-worker who LOVES them. More for her! Thanks for the sample, though!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Keri M.,",05-Nov-18,I loved it. My kids love it too. I had to go back and buy more. We tried all the flavors. . Yes I will tell everyone I know. It doesn't taste like a health food. I wish it was in a store closer to my house. But I decided to make the trip to get it anyway.
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Alexa J.,",06-Dec-18,"Personally, I did not care for Ocean's Halo Seaweed Snacks. I tried sea salt flavor. I thought they would be more like crisps, however they are more paper-like. They also had a bit of a fishy undertone, which makes sense since they are seaweed but I didn't expect it. I would not buy this product again, but I may recommend it to someone who likes this type of food."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Kelsey K.,",16-Nov-18,"I loved my Organic Seaweed Snacks from Ocean's Halo. I am very much a salty snack person and often crave a salty crunchy treat; instead of turning to chips or other unhealthy snacks to satisfy this craving Oceans halo did just that. The perfect balance of salt and crunch, all in one healthy package. I will definitely keep this product in my pantry!"
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jenn M.,",09-Dec-18,I was a bit skeptical on trying these but I do love sushi and sushi wraps so thought I'd give it a go. It was surprisingly good. A little fishy taste and right amount of salt. Definitely a good go to snack that's healthy and won't make me feel bad after eating. It is good alone and I imagine it would be good with some sushi rice also. MIght be an acquired taste but I definitely would recommend this snack.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Brandi H.,",25-Nov-18,"I rally liked trying these out. I have had other brands of seaweed snacks but had never heard of these before this. I really liked the flavors that they come in its very unique. I have tried the chili lime, sea salt and Korean bbq and they all tasted great to me. I noticed that these aren't as chewy and don't get stuck in your teeth as bad as other brands I've tried which is a definite plus. My children and husband gave them a try as well and thought they were ""nasty"", so it's not necessarily a family treat per se, but I really enjoyed them and will continue to purchase and consume them in the future. I'm really looking forward to trying out all the other flavors."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Delila H.,",28-Oct-18,"The seaweed snacks were nice and crispy, but probably not something I am going to make a regular snack our of. The sea salt one was pretty good, with a nice salty/grassy flavor, but the bacon one was kind of not natural tasting, and came across more fishy. Product and packaging were good, and I used the BOGOF coupons to buy broth and noodles that will be used to make home made ramen - yum!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Veronica D.,",20-Nov-18,Small package with big flavor and crunch. This satisfies my cravings of snacks that's salty and crunchy. I don't have to worry about feeling guilty about eating a whole Ocean's Halo Seawood sheet package. Thank you Social Nature for my coupon so that I can try this yummy healthy snack. #socialnature #oceanshaloseawood #healthysnack #seaweedsnack #
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Mellisa S.,",31-Oct-18,"The seaweed snacks we're okay. Not my typical snack but I would eat it again, my kids didn't like the flavor I chose. I made ramen with the noodles and broth, my kids loved it! It wasn't too mush and had a great flavor. Overall I will purchase these products again in the future."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Lino C.,",13-Jan-19,"I really loved the flavor. I always have seen this type of snacks because I am a follower of Asian culture and I see it on their TV shows but I never thought I was going to be able to try them. I liked the flavor. I tried the Korean BBQ one and it was delicious, I liked that the snack is not bad for you and that actually is a really good source of antioxidants and is good for your skin."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"radhika P.,",25-Nov-18,I have tried the chili lime flavor and it's my first time buying a seaweeds. I liked the flavor and wanted to try this because of it's health benefits. I I received a coupon from social nature to buy this and thanks to social nature for introducing this great product
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Rebecca A.,",13-Dec-18,"These are amazing! They're crunchy and full of flavor. I tried two types - the Sriracha and the Maui Onion. The flavors were both very different - one was spicy and one was pretty sweet...but they were both bursting with flavor, slightly salty, and crunchy. These were a perfect little snack, especially when one is craving something salty. I love that they're also made with sustainable ocean-farmed seaweed and non-GMO ingredients! Yes!! Thank you, @socialnature, for letting me try this product for FREE. #trynatural"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"LETISHA W.,",05-Nov-18,"This was my 1st time trying anything seaweed so my interest was definitely peaked!! Absolutely delicious and a healthy alternative to snacking. This seaweed snack is also so much better than I would of ever thought it too be. I heard other brands can be fishy so I must say these are less fishy and oily, The flavors are interesting and varies in a good way... and my kids LOVES THEM!!! Which I was completely shocked about...So I definitely buying more and making these healthy snacks apart of my household..."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Alexis M.,",24-Nov-18,"This was my first time trying seaweed and I opted for the Korean Bbq Snack Sheets. I will say it is different than the normal snack chips. It definitely was interesting to try. The first two bites were ok than after that I didnt really care for it. I am interested in trying the ramen noodle bowl tho. I did like how healthy they were tho. And my little girl loved them. I still give it 4 stars because it Is a decent healthy snack. It's not 5 stars because the price is too high for me. PROS. USDA-Certified Organic Seaweed Natural Sea Salt 20 calories per serving High in Vitamin B-12 and Iodine Non-GMO, Certified Vegan CONS. Too expensive for me to buy as a snack. Greasy and Left a wierd after taste."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"crystal M.,",22-Jan-19,"So what I decided to try was the Ocean's Halo seaweed snack sheets Maui onion flavor. I have tried multiple types of seaweed snack sheets, and I would have to say that I like these the most because they are organic, and have a variety of different flavors to try. I loved them."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Hayley D.,",17-Nov-18,"I tried the Sea Salt flavor of the seaweed snacks and trust when I say I've tried many brands of seaweed snacks! Ocean's Halo was a lovely mild flavor that keeps it from getting too fishy but is still oceanic! The crunch was great as were the snacking size of the package. I'm going to use the coupons to try more flavors such as the Chili Lime and Wasabi- if these are as good as they sound, I'll be in for a treat. This is a lovely snack because it's as satisfying to chew as chips but, like, 10% of the calories for the amount of time you spend eating. This healthy snack is going to become a staple."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Tammy H.,",03-Dec-18,"I would recommend Organic Seaweed Snacks by Ocean's Halo to my family and friends since they have delicious flavors. I tried bacon and sea salt flavor and was very impressed by its taste. also my kids love these seaweed snacks in their lunchbox or on-the-go. These snacks are made with ocean-farmed seaweed and non-GMO ingredients, these facts are important for staying healthy."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Cynthia G.,",07-Dec-18,"Organic Seaweed Snacks were really good I like this as a snack when I am at work in the middle of the night better for u...then something sweet.Now not ever store has this ..not yet hoping they well.The only 3 I could get was Korean BBQ,Sea salt,and Wasabi.....liked them all."
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Stephanie H.,",22-Jan-19,"i have never tried anything with seaweed in it, so i was a little hesitant on these but excited to try none the less. i really wanted to like these, but i just didn't. maybe if you're already a fan of seaweed, these are the snacks for you. i did like the flavoring to them, but i think it was the seaweed flavor that ruined it for me in the end."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Sara R.,",24-Dec-18,"I enjoy trying new things, so was excited to try this alternative to chips. It has a Very strong taste of seaweed, an ocean fishy taste. The amount of salt was a good ratio on them though. I ate them just by themselves, but I could see using it in a recipe where I would use spinich or kale. Otherwise, I would not eat it just raw."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Meryss P.,",19-Nov-18,"I received a voucher from Social Nature for a free Ocean's Halo organic seaweed snack. I have had a gastric bypass, so I am always looking for new healthy snacks that I am able to eat. These are in well-portioned snack sizes that were convenient to throw into my purse for work. Initially they seemed a bit salty, but then they had a smooth flavor. (No salt grains like some other sushi sheet snacks). I love that they are organic, because I can always taste the difference. Will buy again."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Danielle H.,",16-Nov-18,"I wasn't sure if I would like these. I don't mind seaweed in sushi or sometimes mixed in with soups and other things. I picked the bacon flavor, which had a nice bacon taste to it. They still had a strong seaweed flavor, which isn't surprising, but they were just a little too much for me. I think these are a great quality and if you like seaweed snacks I think you would like these."
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Debbie B.,",29-Oct-18,I just used the Sea Salt Halo organic seaweed snacks to snack on. I didn't care for them just because I'm not used to eating that type of food. I do like the fact they are organic and better for you than regular snacks. I'm sure other people might find them amazing.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Andie Y.,",06-Jan-19,"I'm so used to eating regular seaweed that I never imagined it coming in a variety of flavors. Boy, was I blown out of the water by this! It was delicious! I usually eat my seaweed wrapped up in rice but I could totally eat this as a snack by itself. It's not salty at all and has the right amount of flavor."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Crystol D.,",16-Dec-18,I've tried seaweed snacks but nothing like this! I was surprised at the flavor as I didn't think Korean bbq would come out tasting so good on seaweed. The snack is not overly salty and is fresh and crisp. I will be purchasing these snacks for myself and my kids.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Anna L.,",27-Nov-18,"I loved the seaweed! It was crunchy and seasoned just right. It wasn't too oily either, compared with other seaweed snack products. I received a coupon to try this product for free, and I want to try more Ocean's Halo products because of this seaweed."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jamie L.,",16-Nov-18,I tried the Ramon Noodle bowl because that's all my store carried..and my first thought was eeewww broth is milky looking...wasn't expecting that... I cooked it for 3 mins an let set 2...and the noodles soaked up the broth pretty well and I used the whole package of chili peppers and I was extremely surprised... Its delicious! Like I wasnt expecting that at all...considering it smells gross! But that's the soymilk its made with.
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"E G.,",25-Nov-18,"I redeemed my coupon for the Ocean's Halo nori seaweed sheets and used it to make a cucumber roll. This was my first time making sushi! The seaweed sheet seems stiff but rolls really well, even thought I used parchment paper instead of a bamboo mat! However, it was somewhat hard to cut once it was rolled. My pieces ended up being too big for one bite, and the nori was also a little hard to bite through. Besides that, it worked really well for my sushi roll. By itself, the nori has a fishy taste (I assume this is normal), but that wasn't too strong once it was combined with rice and cucumber. Overall, good product, especially for newbie sushi - makers! :)"
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jasmine M.,",29-Oct-18,"I received my coupons from Social Nature to try the Halo seaweed snacks for free. It had a very strong fishy taste. I have eaten seaweed before, I just don't remember it tasting that strong. I still have the buy one get one free coupon which I may try one of the Ramen products."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jesica G.,",06-Feb-19,They were very good. It took me sometime to go get the product I wasn't sure if we were going to like them but I was wrong we do like them .we have already went back to get more2 times this week and its just now thursday. I've been telling everyone about them. THANK YOU for the chance to try them.glad we did
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jill B.,",01-Nov-18,"I didn't try the Seaweed Snacks because the store didn't carry them. Since the coupon was good for all of their products, I went ahead and tried the Ramen noodles with the ramen broth instead. Boy... was it delicious! If all of their products are that amazing, then the seaweed snacks must be awesome! Such flavor! And it's organic! Add a little bit of chile flakes and you're all set!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Dee L.,",13-Nov-18,wow - what a tasty alternative to sweet and sugary snacks when I get the munchies. The taste is delicate and not at all fishy. I like the individual serving size which is easy to take along in my bag or keep in the glove compartment of my car. Am looking forward to trying other flavors.
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Laura S.,",27-Nov-18,"I tried out the Pho Noodle Bowl. My first impression thoughts while cooking is that the color of the broth and the smell while being microwaved wasn't very appetizing. BUT it tasted good, and the optional jalapenos gave it some good heat, which i liked. The portion was a bit on the small side, but I like the plant based packaging."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jamie F.,",22-Nov-18,"Available in seven delicious flavors, including: Sea Salt Chili Lime Korean BBQ Bacon Wasabi Perfect in a lunchbox or on-the-go Made with sustainable ocean-farmed seaweed and non-GMO ingredients I have recommended these to my mom and my Aunt and my sister they absolutely love these !! We have bought more and will continue to enjoy these!!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Tyeriah T.,",05-Dec-18,I love bacon flavored products. I never heard of bacon seaweed snack sheets let alone Halo products at all. This is by far my favorite healthy snack that I have had in awhile. It was very refreshing and did not make me feel gross like other snacks do. I'd buy it again!
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Nicole M.,",22-Nov-18,"I thought that the Ocean's Halo seaweed chips were a unique treat for me. As I never had them before. The sea salt flavor was delicious! A crunchy delight. Also, I liked the bite, a spicy, the flavor (spicy for me) of the chili lime seaweed chips! I recommend!"
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Kathleen N.,",01-Dec-18,"I tried oceans halo seaweed snack sheets in sea salt. I thought they were light and crispy with the right amount of sea salt. I liked that they were organic, I gave some to my grandaughters age 4 and 5 years. They loved them too! I would recommend these snacks to everyone.#GotitFree from social nature!"
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Coco W.,",31-Oct-18,I received a coupon in the mail from Ocean's Halo for a free bag of their Sea Salt Organic Seaweed Snacks in return for my review of said product as a member of Social Nature! These snacks are a great alternative to normal chips that are full of preservatives and unhealthy ingredients! The variety of their flavors is an added plus! I would recommend this snack to anyone who likes a crunchy snack that is healthy and good for you!
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Cristina C.,",07-Feb-19,I thought of trying their Sea Salt Seaweed. I thought the snack was filling and flavorful yet light! I really enjoyed the size of the package and how easy it was to eat the seaweed pieces. The crisp of the snack was perfect and I had no issues with any spillage!
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Charries S.,",22-Feb-19,"This stuff is DELICIOUS!!! I really enjoyed Ocean's Halo Sea Salt Sea Weed Snacks. If you enjoy traditional seaweed, this is it. I've tried several brands and they all use WAY too much oil or the seaweed is too thick. This seaweed is perfectly thin and crumbly, salted and lightly seasoned. Ocean's Halo Seaweed is a bit different from the other seaweed. Ocean's Halo Seaweed is lightly roasted then lightly salted for an exquisite, healthy treat everyone in your family will love! Thanks to its many health benefits of seaweed, it is a staple in our home. Ocean's Halo is 100% natural premium seaweed in a convenient little package. Rich in trace minerals and vitamins. Great source of Iodine. No hassle-Ready to serve. Perfect size to carry in your bag for anytime snack. No Sugar, No Preservatives. No Cholesterol, No Trans Fat. Roasted and lightly salted with natural sea salt, it has a wonderful nutty flavor. One pouch would definitely be great for a rice bowl, salad or just a snack in between your day."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jacqueline B.,",06-Nov-18,"Ocean's Halo seaweed snacks were very tasty and delicious! I had tried the Bacon flavor because that was all that was available, but I'm curious to try other flavors. It's amazing how significant seaweed is because it tasted just like sushi, minus the fish and rice! I will definitely purchase them again."
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Tracy D.,",11-Mar-19,It was not a pleasing flavor or texture in my opinion. Perhaps if I had tried an actual flavor & not just sea salt my opinion would be different. I was unable to find the other flavors at the store I went to though so I tried what they had. I will not be purchasing it again.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"April C.,",16-Nov-18,"I tried Ocean's Halo Bacon and Sea Salt seaweed snack for the first time and I'm hooked, both was so good. It has a light texture and isn't flaky. I will be buying more and telling family and friends about the seaweed snack with low calories and it's a healthy snack."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Martha A.,",20-Nov-18,I thought when I first looked at the snack that I was not going to like the taste of the seaweed snack. It was actually pretty good. I loved the chili lime flavor. It had the right amount of spice. I am looking forward to trying other flavors such as the sea salt and the bbq's flavor. The package has the right amount of product to fill you. I would totally recommend to my family and friends. It is a very healthy snack.
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Brenda H.,",07-Jan-19,I am so glad I was able to try these. I'm not sure if I would have bought it just seeing it sitting on a shelf but after being able to try this product I am definitely going to be adding this to my shopping list. I have already shared with a couple friends they HAVE to try these because I know they will love them. I like how's there is a good variety and can't wait to try the others. I did share with my kids and got mixed reviews from them.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Cadijra W.,",02-Dec-18,"These amazing little snacks are so delicious. The flavors I tasted were Sea salt, Bacon, Chili lime, and Korean BBQ. They all Tasted great, but my favorite out of the 4 is the Korean BBQ. The snacks are light, crispy and has the right amount of seasoning. Let's just say, if you like sushi you will love these!"
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Brinda V.,",30-Nov-18,I will say that this is definitely an acquired taste. Either you like it or not. I personally thought it was ok but don't think I will be buying any more anytime soon. My daughter on the other hand loves them. She eats them all day. Like I said it's an acquired taste.
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Monique B.,",19-Dec-18,"We really enjoyed our taste testing event we set up for the kids, it was presented to the kids and a few friends, as we were trying new flavors of salsa! I refilled the chip bowls and left the bag on the table so they could see!! ""Seaweed""?? We had a great time with this, and the kids loved the seaweed chips best with peach salsa, and the kids friends all want to be notified of any future ""trick"" tastings!! They love the seaweed chips! I love that they love them! Thanks! I did receive this product for free, and for review purposes #trynatural #gotitfree"
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Sonia L.,",25-Oct-18,"Was a little weary about trying seaweed but after the first bite it wasent so bad, I tried the chili lime flavored.. That lime first hits your taste buds then after a few chews the chili hits the back of your throat. My kids loved it.. Yes I will be buying more .☺"
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Debbie G.,",12-Feb-19,I'm a big fan of seaweed snacks so I was super excited to give these a try. I was really looking forward to tasting the bacon flavor but it was impossible to find so I guess it wasn't meant to be. I was able to find the sea salt flavor and boy were they tasty. They were salty with out being overly so. They were nice and thin but not too thin. They also did not have an overly fishy taste that some seaweed snacks often have. I will definitely be putting these in my shopping cart again.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Daneilia F.,",06-Dec-18,I'd never tried seaweed before so I was very nervous to try. I'm glad I tried it. It was a very interesting flavor and texture. I can't say that I didn't like it but I can't say I did. Maybe if I got a different flavor I would have enjoyed it more. I plan on buying some of the other flavors to try and see if I like any of those better.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Mary M.,",04-Dec-18,The Organic Seaweed Snacks from Oceans Halo my family had never tried them till now.We really liked the taste of the sea salt ones a lot .They have no GMO in them.So its a great snack to purchase.With being organic snacks we try to keep them in our home.So we loved them.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Elizabeth T.,",02-Dec-18,"I thought these were delicious! So did my four year old and let me tell you, she is one picky snack eater. She really enjoyed the bacon flavored one. I enjoyed the sea salt and wasabi flavors. I will definitely be buying these for now on and tell anyone who likes seaweed to give these a try!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Cedonia D.,",15-Nov-18,"I love the taste of sea salt, so I got the sea salt flavor. It was my first time ever eating a seaweed snack and I was shock how much I enjoyed the taste. I also used a sheet in my noodle bowl and wow the intense flavor was amazing! Can't wait to try the other flavors!!!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Koko H.,",15-Nov-18,I really enjoyed these seaweed snacks. They're just like the ones from the Asian market except without the briny fish flavor (I love the traditional ones but these were just so refreshing). The packaging was neat and clean and the product was intact. I love them and will be buying again.
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Kimberly M.,",04-Dec-18,I used the Chili Lime by Oceans Halo. I used it for fish tacos. They turned out delicious! I will be trying the other flavors offered by Oceans Halo in the near future. Thank you very much to Social Nature and Oceans Halo for letting me Try before buying.
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Mercedes V.,",25-Nov-18,"So I've never tried anything sea weed before because eating sea weed sounds kinda scary for the prices I've seen it for, so when I seen this up to try I jumped on it and luckily got picked. So I tried the bacon kind which had great flavor and perfect crunch but super weird texture. I didn't mind the first couple bites but by the 3rd bite started tasting not so good I felt. I'm sure someone who enjoys seaweed would enjoy this and I've told a few people and gave out a couple coupons to them also to try. I didn't enjoy them a great deal to spend as much money on them as they want to re buy for myself again."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Tracie D.,",29-Nov-18,These Organic Seaweed Snacks are so tasty. When I first got the Sea Salt flavor package I couldn't wait to get home to try it so my kids and I ate it in the grocery store parking lot. So GOOD! I buy this every week now. My family has it every night on their salad.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Bess C.,",15-Nov-18,"I would definitely buy this again, in fact, I already have! The Bacon flavor is vegan so that's an unexpected bonus! The price is also better than other seaweed snacks. My 8-year-old took one pack to school w him and all his friends wanted to try a sheet!"
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Sukky R.,",25-Nov-18,"I didn't expect to like these snacks as much as I do. They taste pretty good. My hubby loved them and I do plan on buying them. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars because I thought they would be like major healthy and they're not horrible for you but there is definitely lower Cal snacks. Other than that I adore it,"
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Madison L.,",17-Dec-18,"I really enjoyed the flavor of the Halo wasabi flavor! They had just the right amount of spice you want with wasabi flavoring without being overpowering. They were also really crunchy, which I love when it comes to seaweed snacks. I will be buying these again!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Hannah M.,",28-Nov-18,"I decided to purchase the Sea Salt Seaweed Snacks so I could compare it to many other Korean seaweed products I have tried in the past. I thought that the product had a great crispiness to it and was flavorful without being overly salty. A fantastic snack to have on your own or wonderful to complement a simple Korean meal of rice and side dishes. Would be open to trying other flavors, but would probably only consume them for snacking purposes. TL;DR, a healthy, tasty, low-calorie snack that I highly recommend."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Michelle C.,",04-Nov-18,So I received my coupons last week and while I was at Dillon's I picked up some of the Oceans Halo Seaweed Snack. I must say I was a bit skeptic.. I have had organic seaweed and wasn't a fan of the product. That was however until I tried this product. I was amazing and so tasty that I went back to the store to purchase more.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Cassandra C.,",26-Oct-18,I thought I was getting the product mail to me already not a cupon but it's okay I just recently recieved it so I'll be going to the store soon to buy this product and even though I haven't got it yet I already talked about it on my social medias. I'm excited to get this I can't wait to test it out for the first time.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jessa T.,",07-Jan-19,"I am not the biggest fan of dried seaweed, but I figured I would give this a shot. As predicted, it is very salty (but what seaweed isn't?). The Bacon flavor was not as prevalent as I would have liked, but for a dried seaweed fan, I'm sure this is a perfectly acceptable snack. The price point was very affordable, which was nice. I definitely want to try some of the other Ocean's Halo products."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Latoya C.,",18-Dec-18,Ocean's Halo was by far my favorite seaweed snack I have purchased. The flavor was wonderful. I have tried a few other brands but this one took the cake. The texture was crunchy and satisfying. I usually take these on the go when I'm running short on time but I found myself eating them even at home. My four year old even liked them! Which is rare because she is very picky.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Michelle C.,",12-Jan-19,"I love seaweed snack and I have now found my new favorite brand! Ocean's Halo snack have a variety of flavors to choose from, are organic, a good price, healthy and yummy. I like that they are easy to throw in my purse or glovebox for an easy on the go snack. I highly recommend Ocean's Halo Seaweed Snacks!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"James D.,",02-Dec-18,"I loved these! They were not as spicy as I expected, although I suspect that is a good thing for most people (I like intense flavors). This is the perfect snack if you want something flavorful, healthy, and low cal. I will definitely be getting these in the future."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Angel W.,",12-Dec-18,I enjoyed the Ocean's Halo seaweed snack sheets. Generally I purchase large plain seaweed big sheets and have to wait them and roast and then cut with scissors. These are the perfect size and very convenient as to put rice and veggies in and roll. And did I mention saves me a ton of time when I'm always on the go. Very easy to pack in my container for lunch or if I just want to throw in a Ziploc bag and ear throughout the day. Very healthy. My only complaint is it was a little salty for my taste.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"amanda H.,",31-Oct-18,"We got the ramen bowl kit, and I have to say it just was not our thing. It wasn't inedible, the noodles were great, we just did not like the broth. You can very much tell it is kelp/seaweed based. We would much prefer a chicken/beef base. However for someone who is more in to that seaweed flavor profile in a soup, it would probably be great."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Brittany Y.,",30-Dec-18,"I adored the Ocean's Halo seaweed snacks! They were so light and crispy with an airy crunch and lightly salted flavor. I ate them plain as a light snack, they were so yummy and just made me feel great. I would recommend these to anyone who loves a fresh, healthy snack that will not leave you feeling any regret or sluggishness. This is a snack you can feel good about eating and really enjoy. It is now one of my go-to healthy snacks that I can enjoy eating while I am working, as they are both convenient and delicious. This is one of the best snacks I have ever tried, without question."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Christie C.,",16-Nov-18,"I absolutely loved this seaweed snack !!! I got the sea salt flavor . Literally after my first bite , I was instantly sad that I just had one package !! Yes !!! They are that good !!! I couldn't help myself , I had to run out and pick up more !! Very very delicious!"
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Elizabeth S.,",04-Dec-18,"My family really enjoyed the different flavors and are already asking to have these seaweed snacks on our regular grocery list. The favorite so far is the sea salt flavor. I often have an issue with texture while eating, but have absolutely no problems with this snack!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Deborah J.,",18-Nov-18,"YUM YUM YUM. These will not fill you up, but will satisfy a craving for something when you don't know what. I have to force myself not to eat the entire packet in one sitting. I love the fact that they are full of B12 and iodine which are things I have heard are good for people with hypothyroidism."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Stephanie R.,",26-Dec-18,I enjoyed the flavor and quality. This product was easier to handle then other brands and was great w raw fish. I will buy this again. I ahve had a lot of products as i am a health food eatter and this one has the qualoty and taste i would reccomend to everyone.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Elizabeth D.,",30-Nov-18,"These seaweed packs are fantastic, and for a fraction of the price! They are tasty, and unlike past seaweed packs I have previously encountered they come in a variety of assorted flavors to choose from! All local stores sell it, which is great for me who craves them a lot. Before I had to make a long drive to buy them elsewhere."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Candace B.,",10-Jan-19,"I'm a big fan of quality seaweed products and I absolutely love the brand "" Ocean's Halo"". This brand has some of the best seaweed snacks that is on the market with the greatest variety. I like to have this snack before my workout each day or when I'm on the go. I would highly recommend this to others that enjoy light healthy snacks with a great taste."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Amanda F.,",11-Dec-18,"These were fun to eat. I love the texture and how salty they are. They are very thin and sort of dissolve in your mouth. Definitely hit the spot when I was craving something savory. I wish there were more in the package though. The Sea Salt flavor was my favorite of the two I tried. I was reluctant to try the Bacon, but the flavor was subtle and worked better than I had anticipated. I wish I could have tried other flavors. These were hard for me to find."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Marian R.,",01-Nov-18,I have used products from Ocean's Halo before and have been very happy with the quality and flavor so was very happy to try and review the Organic Seaweed snacks. My family eats seaweed a lot mostly with rice so these Seaweeds snacks in Chile lime flavor really excited me. My family and I loved the flavor .I liked that is made from ocean farmed seaweed and non GMO ingredients. I have already bought two more bags in different flavors to try..I feel good giving my kids these to snack on.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Heather W.,",07-Nov-18,"I love that seaweed is tasty! The unique flavors are not overpowering. I tried the Korean BBQ and it has the true Korean BBQ taste on a light, crunchy chip, which is actually seaweed (full of nutrients, and not actually a chip). It's a win when my kids love a healthy snack as well."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Brecken B.,",05-Dec-18,"I thought they were good. They were definitely a good value for the money. I didn't think the sea salt flavor came through as strongly as it could have, and that was slightly disappointing, but not enough to take away from their overall goodness. I also didn't think they were as crispy as they should have been, but that slightly added to their uniqueness from other brands."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Julianne D.,",04-Nov-18,"The Sushi Nori Sheets are packed with Vitamin B12 and Iodine! Personally, I do not particularly enjoy the taste of seaweed. It is alright, but not something I would buy. If I were to buy seaweed, I think Ocean's Halo is one of the better brands because it is completely natural with no additives. It is very expensive though for the smallness, and the lightness of seaweed."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Hannah A.,",17-Dec-18,"OMG I tried the chili lime halo seaweed snack sheet thing! It was awesome! I make a rice cracker snack mix, and I added that to it, which just topped it off perfect! It's slightly spicy with that awesome hint of lime aftertaste. I was wary to try the spicy looking one, because I don't care for spicy, but it wasn't too bad at all!"
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jennifer B.,",05-Nov-18,"I tried the Oceans Halo seaweed snacks in sea salt flavor. I did like the overall experience I had with the product, but I wish I could have found the flavors The product was also a bit hard to locate in my area. I hope to try the flavors with my coupons I received in the mail as well. Texas bbq sounds so good!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Maile L.,",05-Jan-19,"I loved the seaweed snacks! Perfect replacements for chips, especially because it comes in different flavors. I've also tried their noodles and sauces, which was also very flavorful! This has definitely been added to my grocery list! #trynatural #gotitfree"
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Hannah D.,",01-Nov-18,"I redeemed my free Ocean's Halo coupon on the Ocean's Halo ramen noodles, I paired them with my own homemade chicken noodle broth as well as adding a few canned mushrooms and sauteed onions. The noodles were soft and really soaked up the flavors. I can't wait to try the other products with my special coupons! Thank You again for this awesome sampling opportunity and I hope I get another chance to try before I buy. A+"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Christina W.,",24-Nov-18,I really like the seaweed snack. I got the sea salt flavor. It tastes more flavorful than regular salt or without the sea salt but was not too salty after eating all pieces in one package. The seaweed was roasted and has organic ingredients. The Seaweed has great nutrition and exceptional benefits for the health if eaten long term. I definitely recommend this.
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Terry H.,",25-Nov-18,I bought this product to see if my picky eater 6 year old grandson would like them as a new snack. He actually liked the product and asked me to pick up more. I plan to slowly introduce new flavors to him. I am looking forward to offering him more snack options that are also healthy. I will definately tell others about these products.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Tiffany C.,",18-Nov-18,I really enjoyed Ocean's Halo Organic Seaweed Snacks very much. I tried the Korean BBQ flavor. It tasted very good and had a good texture. I like that this product is healthier than chips but still satisfies you. I highly recommend this product and look forward to trying more flavors in the future!
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Frances R.,",28-Jan-19,"I had seen this brand and products before, but never bought any. Getting it free to try was awesome and I'm so happy I did. I have bought several other products from them after the free one. My husband and I loved it that much. The taste was just right and not super salty. We even bought some when my brother came over and he liked them as well. Every product we've bought so far, we've liked. But I only choose flavors that I know I'll most likely like. I honestly thought I wasn't going to like the seaweed snacks, but very surprisingly I loved it. Amazing flavor. I traded my potato chips for those."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Debbie B.,",15-Nov-18,"Never tried anything like this ever, I was very pleased with the flavor. I got the Sea Salt flavor and put it in my Tomato soup. I wasn't quite sure how to eat this so I thought it would be good in soup. I loved it, it brought a unique taste to the soup. It made it more flavorful and I am anxious to try the other brands as well. I told my family about this and they said they would be willing to try it as well. I recommend this to all who are interested, great flavor and healthy as well. A win, win situation."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Trinity J.,",30-Oct-18,"I love it! The seaweed snacks are good on their own, or you can have them with cream cheese, avocado, smoked salmon, spicy mayo, or just whatever makes you happy! I'll definitely buy these in the future, especially if I'm going to be entertaining guests! It's fun to mix it up and have a treat that no one is expecting. :)"
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"John S.,",12-Dec-18,I did not know what to expect. I ate them straight from the package like a chip. I moved it around in my mouth. it tasted like Susi with a hint of bacon. It gave me a good Susi fix without eating. I would enjoy eating them once every week or so. Need to try the other flavors.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Natalie B.,",07-Dec-18,I never really tried this product so is very excited to get the coupons and the free product I thought it was a really really good it actually tasted amazing I bought a whole bunch of other products I really did love this sample service it was really nice easy convenient fast and everything was all around amazing I would definitely recommend everything to a friend thank you
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Tiffany F.,",10-Nov-18,My 8 year old son loves seaweed snacks and this one has become a favorite. He especially liked the Sea Salt over the Chili Lime flavor. Mommy liked the Wasabi! I liked that he was choosing a healthy snack over a bag of chips. I like the price and the serving sizes are perfect for lunch or an after-school snack. Also being Organic has the added benefit of no preservatives that he doesn't need while not losing the flavor that he likes.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Toya B.,",15-Feb-19,I love the Oceans Halo seaweed snacks! The seasalt and teriyaki flavor are my favorite ones! Whenever I need an easy healthy snack for my daughter I go to the store and pick some of these up! I recommend all parents keep these stocked up in their houses! Next my daughter and I will try out the nori sheets to make sushi
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"sarah W.,",07-Feb-19,I love the texture and the way this has such a light crunch yet melts right in my mouth. The flavor was perfect and cant wait to buy more! My children also love these and we all know how hard it is to find a good healthy snack for our kids to munch on after school. My 4 year old son loves these more than i do and i barely even got any lol.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Bobbi B.,",29-Oct-18,"I received a few coupons for Ocean's Halo organic seaweed snacks as well as other Ocean's Halo products. I ran to the store to try them, because I'm always willing to try new things. They were amazing! I have the chili lime seaweed snacks and absolutely loved them! Will purchase again!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Joan M.,",26-Nov-18,"Oceans HALO seaweed snack is so tasty. I just ate mine as a snack. I wanted for the first time trying to get a true taste. Because it's organic, it was very tasty. It tasted like seaweed should taste and the texture was perfect. I did buy it and would highly recommend this product!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Phyllis C.,",06-Dec-18,These are so good they're addictive! I have tried different flavors of the seaweed snacks and like them all. My favorite is the Chili Lime which is deliciously zesty with a kick. Seaweed is one of the best food sources of iodine. Ocean's Halo seaweed snack is seasoned with mostly organic ingredients.
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Pat M.,",01-Nov-18,I tried Sea Salt Organic Seaweed Snack. I found the texture and taste very nice. The flavor was light with mouth the sea salt not being overpowering. The texture was not crumbly. It felt more like a melting into the rice that I ate it with. I definitely recommend it!!!
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jenny Y.,",05-Dec-18,"I'm not sure about these Seaweed snacks, I kind of like them, and I kind of don't. At first, they taste kind of gross, and the texture is something that I'm not used to, but after eating one, I kind of like it. I think if I get used to how these taste, and the texture, I will really like them."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Maggie B.,",28-Nov-18,The Seaweed Snacks are pretty good. They tasted much better than I thought they would. It is not the best ever or something I would crave though. But I like that they are a nice healthy snack. I tried the Chili Lime flavor which was pretty good. I guess I feel better knowing they are organic and actually good for me.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Lavonne A.,",08-Jan-19,The only reason I am not giving a higher rating is my store only carried the chili lime flavor. I am not the biggest fan of that one. I prefer the Sea Salt option. This was a good snack. They are easy to toss in your lunch bag for on a salad or just to eat alone. I prefer to use them in salads. The lime flavor comes through on this chili lime one. On the sea salt ones I like the saltiness of them.
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Deyna C.,",10-Nov-18,"I really like seaweed snacks! I have never tried an Ocean's Halo product before, but the Sea Salt flavor that I tried did not disappoint. Seaweed snacks won't fill you up, but they do take the edge off of the hunger. The price point for these is incredible! They cost substantially less than the brans that I have bought before. I can picture myself buying these again. My only complaint is that I had to search for them in my area and when I found them, the only available flavor was Sea Salt. I would rather have tried some of the other flavors that set this brand of seaweed snacks apart from others. Maybe later."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Lorraine G.,",15-Nov-18,I thought that it was a good snack. Not the best since it had an after taste. It's good for when you need a quick snack on the go and you're hungry. I would recommend to those who enjoy eating healthy and don't mind the after taste. It is missing something but I'm not exactly sure what that is.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Rebecca P.,",28-Oct-18,"My first thoughts were how cheap it was and how stylish the packaging was. I initially thought that it would be the same as other seaweed snacks I have tried but I was blown away by this brand! It brought me back to my childhood, visiting Pismo Beach and being out in the ocean on a nice warm day! It was so fresh and delicious and that was just the Sea Salt flavor. I can't wait to try more of the other flavors!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jessica H.,",20-Nov-18,I was hesitant to try these even after purchasing just because I didn't know what to expect. My only experience with seaweed is sushi.. until now. I did it! I tried the sea salt in an attempt to get a true taste of what seaweed snacks are all about without flavor to disguise it.. they were great! Similar to a kale chip in my opinion. I would definitely be open to giving the other flavors a try.
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Kimberly C.,",06-Dec-18,"Crispy and good. I liked these. I got the Bacon flavor. These make a great, simple, crispy snack. It's heathly, perfect size and I love that it has so many flavors. I will probably try the Siracha next. I would definitely recommend to others seeking a different kind of snack."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jodi H.,",27-Nov-18,The food that you sent was alot better tasting than I thought it would be. Especially where they are good for you. This food is definitely something that is going to be included in my children's snacks and lunchtime menus. Thank you for sending the free sample.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Brooke A.,",27-Nov-18,I'm not a big fan or nori snacks but I do like it in sushi. This wasn't terrible but Inalso didn't love it either. I did like the saltyness and the crunch but I just couldn't get I've the string nori taste. I'm sore if the store I got it from had other flavors it would have been better. I would try another flavor.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Abby L.,",12-Nov-18,"I really liked the Sea Salt flavored Organic Seaweed Snacks from Ocean's Halo that we received free for review. The whole family shared these snacks and while most of us liked them, our little one did not care for the flavor. The texture started out lightly crispy and then softened while eating it, ending up a little bit like the texture of spinach. I was actually pleasantly surprised by the amount of flavor in the Sea Salt variety. I was expecting just a bit of a salty taste, but it was really flavorful! I like these for a healthy snack choice and will get the Bacon flavor next time. My local store only carries the Sea Salt and Bacon flavors that I know of, but I would like to try the other flavors too if I can find them."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Laury D.,",06-Dec-18,"these had a good flavor, i purchased the sea salt flavored Organic Seaweed Snacks by Ocean's Halo. i would like to try a few of the other flavors too, but for the sea salt flavored ones they did seem a little bit over salted if you ask me, but like i said i still liked the flavor, they are just like i remembered from when i was about 13 years old and i ate seaweed ""chips"". I would purchase these again."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Angie C.,",02-Nov-18,"I had the opportunity to try the new Halo seaweed snacks from Social Nature as a free sample. I received a coupon for a free offer along with several other buy one get one coupons from other new Halo products. I choose the shiracha snacks because I like adding some spice in my snacks. It was awesome! Just the perfect amount of flavor. They were so tasty, will be buying these in the future."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Brooke S.,",16-Nov-18,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVED the Ocean's Halo Organic Seaweed Snacks. I try the Sea Salt flavor and they tasted amazing! It is not too much of a "" salty "" taste either. It is just the right amount of salt. They are made with sustainable ocean-farmed seaweed and contain no GMOs in the product. It is the perfect size to pack for lunches too! It is a must have that I highly suggest as a healthy snack for lunches. #GotItFree"
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Eileen T.,",30-Nov-18,I tried the Sea Salt Halo Seaweed Snacks. I did not like anything about the Seaweed Snacks. They were as thin a piece of paper. At first it just had a strong spinach like taste with salt. Then as you chewed it and it softened up a strong fishy taste emerged. Yuk! I never had any type of fish taste this fishy.
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Michelle A.,",25-Nov-18,"I was unsure about these at first, but was pleasantly surprised by their flavor. It was really good and I would recommend them to anyone who is wanting to try a healthier snack. I am not a big seaweed fan, but. I would definitely purchase them again."
1,BARF!!!,"steve,",28-Jan-19,Don't listen to the others unless you like the taste of rotting fish. I had a tiny bite and almost barfed. My dogs wouldn't eat it at first then they did but they like whitefish dog food so maybe that's why I highly recommend not eating it but pranking friends into eating it.
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Delta B.,",25-Nov-18,"I didn't like the texture or the taste that much. I tried other products like this in the past and I know it all natural and organic so I try to make myself like these types of products and I'm just not into it. What I mean by ""these types of products,"" is knowing that I'm actually eating seaweed. I've tried 2 other seaweed organic products sort of like HALO, but I can't get past the fact that its seaweed. I love organic items though, they're my favorite products because I know that there's no chemicals or pesticides and other added substances to make a product better tasting, but in all reality, it's not good for you. I love organic, but I will eat non-organic items as long as I read the ingredients and it's favorable to me. I will literally read every ingredient and the amount of vitamins, minerals, sugars, cholesterol, fats, etc in items that are new to me. I love trying new things, but I have to say I didn't necessarily enjoyed eating this. I didn't use the buy one get one coupons that were sent because I haven't used them yet. I intend to because it looks like there are different HALO products to try other than the seaweed one. I'm just giving my honest feedback, but others might enjoy this product. Thank you for letting me try this for free and the additional coupons that will be used in the future."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Carolyn Y.,",19-Jan-19,"I had a lot of trouble finding this product. I finally found it, and since there were limited choices I went with Sea Salt. I liked it. It was a fun snack, not greasy or too salty. I also bought some broth...definitely not what I expected. I don't see where I can review that, but if I find it I will. I liked the seaweed snacks."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Amanda M.,",04-Nov-18,"I love seaweed snacks and was able to try out the Ocean's Halo brand. They...are...amazing! There are several different flavors all yummy which makes it hard to choose a favorite. If I had to choose good ol' sea salt is my tops. They are a yummy, healthy snack that will satisfy your hunger and hankering for a snack."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Brandy M.,",10-Dec-18,"I have never tried Miso broth or anything made with kelp. I did warm the broth up first....has an interesting smell but not off-putting. I tried it by itself first and it is edible but I am not use to it. It is a strong flavor. I made a combination of asmine rice, grilled chicken, and the miso broth - it was great! Even my 1 year old baby boy tried it and kept coming back to me for more!"
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Zandra L.,",05-Dec-18,"Wasn't a fan of the Ocean's Halo Organic Seaweed Snacks. I tried the bacon flavor and didn't notice any bacon taste whatsoever. I did like that these are a healthy and very affordable, organic snack alternative, however, I really dislike seafood and these taste very fishy to me, as do most seaweed products. If you enjoy seaweed foods though, I think these may be a great snack for you, but they were a pass for me!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jessica R.,",05-Nov-18,I was given the chance to sample Ocean's Halo Organic Seaweed Snacks through Social Nature. I picked the wasabi flavor and thought it had just enough spice on it. I ate these snacks just by themselves for a quick seaweed snack. I love seaweed and love Ocean's Halo and all the flavors they have to choose from. I will be trying all the flavors soon! #trynatural #gotitfree
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"JayLynn P.,",26-Nov-18,I bought the Korean BBQ Organic Seaweed Snacks and I will tell you it was the most tastiest thing I have ever ate. It was exploding with flavor. I had my boyfriend try them who doesn't even like basic seaweed snacks and said they were so amazing. They completely changed his mind. I 100 percent recommend.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Ryan M.,",11-Mar-19,"I'm not too fond of eating anything like this but I decided to give it a try. The aroma when first opening the bad was enough to tell me it was going to be an enjoyable experience. Once I pulled out a piece of see weed, it felt crisp. I then took a bite and my taste buds went out of control. The freshness combined with a hint of salt and finally the crunch. I will be looking for ways to make different snaks with these."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Dana C.,",11-Dec-18,I tried the sea salted seaweed snacks. They are salted just enough if you are craving something salty and you won't feel guilty for eating them. I would definitely recommend them and my husband is going to be taking them to work to snack on now. I will definitely be purchasing more in the future.
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Amy E.,",15-Nov-18,"I liked this product. I thought it was quite versatile (eat alone, with rice, or on soup). Different flavors make it a nice interesting mix to a rice dish or to add extra kick to a soup. I tried the Korean BBQ and chili lime flavors and will likely buy again to keep on hand."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Chelsea W.,",20-Nov-18,I'm in love! I got wasabi and while I'm loyal to that flavor already I'm so excited to try the other flavors. Texture wasn't what I expected but i was so pleasantly surprised! The packaging was so inviting and the retail pricing was affordable. I've already recommended to everyone I know
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Isabel C.,",25-Feb-19,"I already eat seaweed snacks, but they're usually just the normal flavor. Ocean's Halo had such interesting flavors, I didn't know which to try! I got the Korean BBQ and Chili Lime flavors and really loved them. I had some if it as is, and then some with rice. Delicious!"
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Cindy R.,",06-Dec-18,"I bought the Ocean's Halo seaweed snacks in the sea salt flavor. Figured I'd try the base flavor first. These were pretty good. Dry as expected since they are a dried food, but nice if you tear them or chop them up in smaller pieces and use as a topping for rice or ramen."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Michelle P.,",31-Oct-18,"I love the idea of eating seaweed. It has so many nutritional benefits, including providing a bit of iodine for the thyroid. I tried Ocean Halo's sea salt seaweed. Very tasty. I am used to eating ""natural"" type foods. So this wasn't too far out there for me. I also eat sushi, which is rolled in seaweed sheets. The sea salt adds a nice salty taste and some electrolytes, which gives a little energy boost. Love it! I plan on buying again. Thanks!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"mary F.,",17-Nov-18,I tired the sea salt and it was very delicious. I would buy again to have on hand for a quick snack and great for on the go. You are doing good by buying these and the bonus is that they are good for you and taste great. My next flavor I'm going to try will be the chili lime for a little kick. I probably will buy all the broth flavors too :)
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Lisa R.,",11-Mar-19,"First of all, I already love seaweed snack sheets in all forms so this wasn't a hard sell for me. I've eaten similar products from a variety of brands. I wouldn't say these are the absolute tastiest I've ever had. That award goes to a brand that cheats with large amounts of MSG. Instead Ocean's Halo sticks with organic, non-gmo, sustainable seaweed. In my opinion, this makes it easily superior."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Tazia S.,",06-Dec-18,These are great for a little snack and are healthier than a bag of chips. I shared these with my mom and she also liked them even though she doesn't like trying new things. I got the sea salt flavor because its the most basic and you can't really go wrong with sea salt.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Ayumi O.,",27-Dec-18,"I I've seaweed, usually Aleta with rice so didn't this would be a snack. I wanted to try Chile lime flavor but the didn't find it so reluctantly picked Bacon one. It literally bacon flavor and surprisingly not disturbing the seaweed flavor. I had never thought seaweed can be a snack with multiple flavor but I think it's actually it's a new way to enjoy it."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Randi N.,",26-Nov-18,"I wish I could have tried something other than sea salt because it ended up being too salty for me to enjoy. I figured since I like sushi that the nori snacks would also be as tasty, and perhaps the other flavors are but my store only had the sea salt ones and I wasn't a fan, but my fiance liked them."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Robert C.,",03-Dec-18,"I recieved a coupon/voucher for a full size product of Ocean Halo's Seaweed Snacks & I tried out their chili lime flavor. It was pretty good in flavor. I don't regularly eat seaweed but when I do it's usually in sushi, like a veggie sushi. Seaweed on its own or unflavored seaweed is usually kind of bitter & has its own unique or ""special"" taste & could be described as an acquired taste. It usually is a bit more palatable when accompanied by other ingredients. I liked the chili lime seaweed because it has a mild & not too over seasoned flavor of both the chili & lime. I used my package to garnish some fish tacos that I made & it paired pleasantly well. I also crushed up a few & added them to a salad. Speaking for myself I liked the pairing of those two items I used the seaweed with. I didn't snack on the seaweed by itself as I don't eat it that regularly & by itself, flavored or unflavored, I'm not that fond of. It is a great tasting product for being seaweed & is packaged well. I don't think I will be buying it again as I don't regularly consume all that much seaweed as part of my diet. I would recommend it to someone who happens to enjoy it on a more consistent basis or I would pick it up sometime maybe down the line if I happen to be in the mood for something different than the usual snacks or food items I pick up. All in all it is a good product & I do recommend trying it if you're a sushi aficionado & like consuming it more regularly than a person such as myself."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Miranda F.,",20-Nov-18,"I love Ocean's Halo Ramen Broth! The flavors are delicious! You can add noodles, roasted vegetables, boiled eggs, or pork! I really appreciate that it's non GMO! It's super easy to make also! Pour into a saucepan and heat over medium heat while stirring occasionally!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Amanda C.,",29-Oct-18,"I sampled Ocean's Halo Organic Seaweed Snacks in Sea Salt. Taste-wise these definitely satisfied my seaweed snack craving. They had the perfect texture and just the right amount of salt. I like that they're healthy, Non-GMO Project Verified, and made with three simple ingredients. However, I definitely could've put back more than one package. My husband enjoyed them, too, but my toddler refused to try them. More for me then!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Tiana T.,",16-Nov-18,These were actually pretty good! I was excited to try the Bacon flavored and they did not disappoint! I also threw in the sea salt flavor because I had a two for one coupon. Very good! I believe I'll try the chili lime next! Thanks for the opportunity to try them!
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Shawn G.,",04-Nov-18,"My issue with this product is mainly with locating it. The site recommended 2 places that had it. Neither did for weeks. When I did finally find the product, there was not a vast choice. I found the Korean BBQ flavor to be really good for a seaweed snack. Not overpowering and just a little sweet. Even my 16yo liked it. It wasnt incredibly salty which was nice. And was packaged really well. Ovarall it's a really good snack."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Janine H.,",31-Oct-18,"I would HIGHLY recommend these seaweed snacks, I just LOVE LOVE LOVE the TERIYAKI flavor, they are so crispy and no carbs and they are good for your body and way better to me than chips, the plain are good also but I prefer the ones with Korean BBQ and Sea Salt You have to try them and you will be ADDICTED to them, lol"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"ALICIA H.,",01-Nov-18,"I loved this seaweed! I mostly ate it by itself, as a snack between meals. I also added it to my ramen noodles. In both cases, it was amazing! I love the delicately crispy texture, and the light flavor. It was a great guilt-free option for when I get snack cravings. I would definitely recommend it!"
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Crystal F.,",13-Jan-19,Organic Seaweed Snacks were not for me. I was hoping i would like it so i could include something naturally high in iodine into my diet but unfortunately i couldnt do it. Neither of my kids would eat it either... I have never had seaweed so it isnt the brand it is just the taste of seaweed.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Katerina M.,",26-Oct-18,I bought the sea salt flavor and really enjoyed it! So thin and crispy and delicious! I am very glad Social Nature gave me the free coupon to get these plus a bunch of bogo coupons for all oceans halo products. I can't wait to try more Oceans Halo products if they are all as great as these.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Wendy G.,",26-Nov-18,"I tried the wasabi flavor eich had just the right amount of heat. I crubled it up and dusted it over popcorn. It was a nice salty, warm, umami flavor that really elevated our popcorn for movie night. My whole family loved it, even my picky eater three year ould thought it was yummy. We look forward to trying out the rest of the flavors."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Lisa C.,",15-Nov-18,"I tried the bacon flavor. It tasted like regular seaweed snacks that I've had before with a mild bacon flavor. Not bad, but I looked at the ingredients AFTER I tried it & I found maltodextrin listed. Not what I want to see in what is supposed to be a healthy snack! Next time I try another flavor."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Michelle B.,",18-Nov-18,Yum! Such a great healthy snack thats perfect for on the go! Family loves it too and has different flavors to choose from! Kids love it when I put this in their lunch boxes! Made with non GMO and ocean farmed seaweed! Goes great with their miso broth!
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"AMBER G.,",29-Nov-18,"I'd never tried anything like this before. I was rather skeptical at first, I didn't know how I'd feel about eating green seaweed lol. But I wanted to try these. I wasn't crazy about the texture, but the flavor wasn't bad. Although I appreciate the opportunity, I doubt I'll be buying these for myself any time soom."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Lindsey H.,",07-Dec-18,I really liked the Oceans Halo seaweed snack sheets. There were so many fun flavors but I decided to try the sea salt as that really was the most original flavor. Overall it was really good and it was a perfect snack to have at work. Really tasty product and I'd recommend it to anyone looking to add a fun new snack to their schedule.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Beth A.,",09-Dec-18,I have to say that I do not like the texture of the Seaweed Snacks but my son and niece love all the different flavors that the Ocean's Halo comes in. They especially like that it is an easy snack to just throw in their backpacks and have a great tasting crunchy snack on the go.
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Teresa K.,",11-Nov-18,"As part of the social nature program I was able to sample Ocean's Halo seaweed snacks complimentary through their program. I sampled both the sea salt flavor as well as the bacon variety. I have been eating seaweed snacks since I was a little child, and it's definitely a favorite snack of mine. I thought that the Ocean's Halo seaweed snack in sea salt flavor was great. I liked the crispy, light texture of the seaweed sheets. However, the bacon flavor was not my favorite. Although I love bacon, when it is flavor infused into seaweed, it didn't really meet my expectations. I also felt that the bacon flavored seaweed variety was lacking the crispy texture that I enjoyed with the sea salt variety. Overall, I think that Ocean's Halo seaweed snacks are a great snack product. Personally, I would skip the unusual flavors, and choose the sea salt variety, which I found to have great texture and allowed the seaweed flavors to take center stage."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"taryn O.,",16-Nov-18,"I really liked these seaweed snacks! They satisfied my craving for salty and savory foods. It had just the right amount of salt and is a great , light snack! Much better alternative to chips or crackers . I love how they are organic and gluten free ."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Anna H.,",11-Nov-18,I tried the Ocean's Halo Sea Salt seaweed snack. I wasn't sure how they would taste but they were actually very good. I would recommend them to people who are looking for a healthy snack with low salt and big flavor. I will definately be eating this again.
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Alicia C.,",14-Nov-18,I threw one of these in my purse before class and when I got a little hungry it was an awesome and healthy snack. I never thought I would be putting seaweed snacks on my shopping list but I am definitely going to get some more of these maybe try some different flavors and find my favorite
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Ashley C.,",10-Nov-18,I received a voucher for this free product through Social Nature! It was a little too healthy for me I guess lol I added a tad bit of salt on mine and thought it was perfect! It's a great product! Recommend it and think you should buy it if you like this kind of thing!
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"chasity C.,",01-Nov-18,"This product was very interesting. It was my first time trying seaweed in any form. It was crisp, light, and obviously healthy. In my opinion, it was not bad but it is a bit of an aquired taste. It's an easy and healthy snack, very affordable, and super healthy."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Emily S.,",26-Nov-18,"I was a little nervous to try the seaweed snacks to be honest. It didn't sound all that great to me. But I figured, why not try it, your getting it free to try. And it was amazing! Absolutely great taste and tremendous health benefit. I will definitely be buying these for snacks and instead of chips for lunches!"
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"brandy A.,",15-Nov-18,"I thought the product was pretty good but I just couldn't get into it being a food for me on the regular., I did however think that the value of this product was really good and I don't think that people are going to be disappointed if they are into this kind of product.. I will however definitely tell my friends and family about it and let them check it out themselves..."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Kenneth C.,",29-Nov-18,"Great product that is simple, quick and easy and enjoyable to use. I tried this product based on a sample/discount I received and I have to say I will be buying it in the future. Worked as stated and easy to follow instructions. I give this product two thumbs up."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Kelly K.,",14-Nov-18,I was really hoping to try the bacon flavor but I was only able to find the Sea salt in my local store. And to be honest it was a bit to salty. They might be better if you have them with something else. But they are to salty by themselves. I did like the underlining flavor of the seaweed. I intend to check other stores for the other flavors to try.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"April B.,",14-Nov-18,"I loved the flavors of seaweed snacks I tried, the sea salt is just that, a little more upfront flavor on the salt. The bacon flavored is actually what blew me away. Usually bacon flavored products use that nasty artificial bacon additive, this did not! I was super surprised & ended up eating the whole thing at once in just a few minutes. It was just salty enough with not too much powdered flavoring. Overall I would eat these two flavors again & can't wait to see if my store will carry more flavors because I want to try them all now! If you like seaweed then you'll love these."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Brandy O.,",27-Oct-18,"I tried the Maui Onion snacks and they were pretty good. I tried them plain by themselves, then I got the idea that they would be good on burgers. So I put one on a grilled Bay Area burger and it was actually quite good! It was different in a good way. It added more flavor. I think next time I will try it crumbled up into a casserole."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Janessa A.,",05-Jan-19,"Based on the weight of this little package I was not expecting much. However, after opening it, I realized there were several snack sized sheets. They were flexible and not brittle, which allowed me top them with my various snacking veggies. The flavor was great. The sea salt was just right and the overall crunchiness of it was the perfect texture. I can't wait to explore the other flavors offered."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Antonia M.,",07-Nov-18,"I was a little bit skeptical at first because I've never tried a product with seaweed before but to my surprise, it was very tasty. I think these are a really good snack and I like that the ingredients are more natural as opposed to other alternative snacks. I would definitely buy these again."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Stacy B.,",27-Nov-18,This is a very delicious snack! I can eat it just by itself or add them to my Halo Ramen Noodles which makes for a healthy and great tasting meal! I would definitely recommend this product as well as other products by Halo! You can find this in my pantry anytime. Thank you Halo!!
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Kayla K.,",12-Nov-18,"Tried veggie broth! I had chicken broth on my shopping list, but decided to try this veggie broth instead. Good decision! It's a good amount of broth for the regular price (and of course I received it free with this coupon). I'm curious to try the other flavors, especially the coconut thai one"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Chance M.,",27-Nov-18,"Ocean's Halo Organic Seaweed Snacks are little green slices of deliciousness! I tried the sea salt flavor, which is my go to flavor for salty snacks like chips and crackers. It also allows me to get an idea of the basic flavor of these snack. They similar to Sun Chips snacks, just made with seaweed- and they are incredible! I made my boyfriend try one and he was impressed as well. Would definitely recommend Ocean's Halo Organic Seaweed Snacks and have already purchased two more flavors to try- Thank You Ocean's Halo for the free chips! You've gained a customer for life!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Julie R.,",10-Nov-18,"The sea salt seaweed snacks are great!! Perfect amount of salt and the texture of these is good also. Some brands are super fragile and crumble easily. These were all intact still when I got them, and they held together well upon handling them. My family enjoyed snacking on these, and I also added some into a ramen soup I made to add some extra flavor. Very tasty! I can't wait to try the other flavors."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Holly P.,",11-Dec-18,Ocean's Halo seaweed snack sheets in the flavor Sea Salt is a delicious healthy snack whether traveling or at home. I had my reservations about the taste before trying but I'm happy to report that the flavor is great. It wasn't too salty at all. I definitely be returning to the store to purchase the other flavors.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Krystal M.,",31-Jan-19,Awesome! Absolutely loved these! They were perfect. I definitely would recommend these especially if you like new taste and texture. Chilli lime was by far my favorite. Package came in wonderful condition. Chips weren't all crunched up. It was an awesome buy. Can't wait to sample the next flavor available.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Alexis W.,",25-Jan-19,Perhaps I should have have tried a different flavor. I received this product in exchange for my honest review and tried the sea salt flavor. I found the salty flavor a bit too salty and again because it is seaweed perhaps sea salt was not the wisest choice. The texture was good and it was nice and crisp. I may try this product again in the future but I will select a different flavor. #trynatural #gotitfree
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Temre F.,",17-Dec-18,"I really enjoyed the seaweed snacks! They are delicious! I have already recommended them to my daughter and several friends. Additionally, they are organic which is a plus. I have already purchased several different flavors to try and will be buying them on a regular basis now."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Pri R.,",14-Nov-18,Great taste..saves me from eating junk food! Has a nice balance of sweet onion and seaweed..and lightly salted which is a big plus! I carry a pack with me on the go and it really helps fight my mid afternoon cravings. I highly recommend the maui onion flavor!
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Rhaub P.,",07-Nov-18,I used my voucher for the Organic Seaweed Snack. I chose the Sea Salt flavor. I used it as a snack right out if the bag. It was delicious. I was supposed how much flavor it had. Plus I dipped a few in a spinach dip I had made ....yep this is a keeper. I highly recommend. I am going to try the other flavors as well !
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Karen R.,",27-Nov-18,I loved the Oceans Halo Sea Salt Organic Seaweed snacks. It was delicious and its great knowing that it is organic and great for me. I ate them right out of the package. Next time I will try them in a soup. Can't wait to try the other products from Ocean's Halo. thank-you.
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"karolina P.,",29-Oct-18,I honestly could not find the seaweed snacks in any of the stores located in the flyer. And I even when out of town twice to look for the product and nothing. I ended up with the miso noodle bowl to test out and review and wasnt a fan. It tasted very bland. It was very much tasteless.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"SARA K.,",15-Dec-18,The sea salt flavor was delicious and a great guilt-free snack for work. The quantity was just enough and I love that it's vegan. I do wish that the packaging was paper. There was way too much plastic for such a small container. I'm trying to reduce my plastic consumption and I failed miserably on this one.
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Angelle S.,",02-Dec-18,"I love the idea of the brand and the healthy ingredients Ocean Halo uses in their products. However, I personally did not enjoy the Halo seaweed snacks. I shared them with my household, but it was not received well either. I tried the vegan bacon flavor, the texture was interesting, and they sort of melt away in your mouth, but I just did not like the taste at all. They were pretty strong, and I could not get past the first bite. I will try to use them in a Miso soup and see if they will work better to compliment a dish rather than eaten on their own."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Yabbe Baby ❤° C.,",11-Mar-19,I love seaweed snacks as always. I tried a lot of different flavors and I love this sea salt the best. I would love to tried all those other flavors as well. Thanks for giving me the chance to try it out. #trynatural #GotItFree #organic #seaweed #snacks
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Cherrina K.,",04-Nov-18,So I went to the grocery store to redeem my oceans halo seaweed snacks. I chose the Korean BBQ flavor to try. I was skeptical at first because of what it is. I've never tasted sea weed before. But when I tasted them they were so good! My kids even enjoyed them. I went back back and bought more lol.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Julie A.,",27-Nov-18,"Ocean's Halo Organic Seaweed Snacks were delicious. They were just the right blend of salty, crunchy, and savory. They are such a great snack to have on hand since they contain a lot of important nutrients and they are a very healthy choice for snacking! My 3 year old daughter does not like them at this point, but I will keep trying because I would love for her to like these! #trynatural #GotItFree"
5,Good snack,"jbo66,",17-Nov-18,I was looking for a different snack and came across these. Granted they have a little fishy taste but I didn't mind. Has salt with it but makes it taste even better. Not a lot of salt. What is in the pack is filling. Something to consider when looking for a good snack
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Dena T.,",26-Nov-18,This was my first trying anything with seaweed in. My children are always trying to get me to go with them to get sushi but never have now because of Halo' s Seaweed Snacks I just might go the next time. I played it safe for the first time and tried the sea salt snacks very good next time I go to the store I am going to try another one. Thank you for the opportunity to try these amazingsnacks.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Samara A.,",07-Feb-19,"Flavor: Sesame I love these sort of snacks. They are low in calories, fat, and sodium. They have a nice flavor and a delicate (they're thin), not brittle crispness. I've had several cases of them, and have never had problems with broken ones. I used to take them in my lunch and would just throw them in my tote and they remained intact."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jenessa F.,",06-Dec-18,Super good and fast on the go snack for me and my family! I love how convenient these snacks were and how healthy they were! I already bought more for my stash. I really enjoyed that there was different varieties of flavors to try from! At first I wasn't wanting to try but I'm glad that I did
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Sarah T.,",03-Nov-18,"I was SO surprised on how much I liked the flavored seaweed sheets! I do like sushi but I didn't think eating sheets of seaweed would be that great. Well I was wrong!! I tried the sriracha flavor and it was the perfect crunchy and spicy and everything you can imagine! I love that they aren't awful for you. I don't like to give my family any ""bad"" foods. We try to stay eating healthy foods and snacks."
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Pat P.,",13-Dec-18,"I prepared the Miso Noodle Bowl, the exact way directions stated. Nowhere in the directions did it say when to add the soy. The noodles were not cooked enough at the required time so I cooked longer. The taste was not at all to my liking and i have had Miso soup in restaurants. I couldn't even eat it."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Clarissa R.,",26-Nov-18,"I don't really branch out into flavors, but these were good! It was crispy, tasty, and not too greasy. I can't wait to try out more of the flavors. Chili lime and wasabi sound good. The scents weren't too strong either, so it's a good choice for travel or a quick snack."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Sarena T.,",06-Dec-18,"I grew up on seaweed snacks, and now that they've gained popularity, they've only gotten more delicious. Since I was a bit wary of trying any fancy flavors, I went with the Sea Salt one, and it didn't disappoint. It's crunchy, salty, and delicious, though I'm not sure if I would purchase it again, you can easily buy more packs for a cheaper price at Asian grocery stores."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Vanessa A.,",30-Oct-18,The purchased the sea salt flavor. The seaweed snacks are crispy and light. They aren't oily at all. I was very happy with the flavoring it wasn't too much or too little. these would be great to take on a trip or to carry with you if your out and about I look forward to trying other flavors.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Anna M.,",26-Nov-18,"My oceans Halo organic seaweed snacks were AMAZEBALLS! I ended up picking the chili lime which ended up being one of my best choices! I love the crispy texture and the flavor just makes it that much better. I have always liked dried seaweed, but this is my new favorite."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Samantha B.,",07-Feb-19,"I love anything Ocean's Halo so let's get that out of the way. Now when I got the chance to try the new flavors of the Organic seaweed snacks I jumped at the opportunity. Always great flavors and textures, I made sure to share coupons with my friend that is on a keto diet and loved them. #trynatural #gotitfree"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"jane V.,",25-Nov-18,"I'm a plain and simple woman, so Ocean's Halo Sea Salt Seaweed Snacks are my snacking choice. I really love how they melt in my mouth...tasting like sea salt and vegetable....transporting me to ocean side....making me feel like I'm eating something that feeds my body and spirit! Skip the chips! I carry these snacks when I'm foraging for Winters' teaberries, angling for Spring trout, reading a book under our Sun's rays and laying on the bed of my pickup truck-watching Perseid's! Yum!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Frank K.,",16-Nov-18,I loved the Ocean's Halo Organic Seaweed Snacks! The Korean BBQ snacks were very flavorful. I ate them on the go in my car as I ran my errands when stuck in traffic. I felt good eating them because I know they are very good for me. A nice healthy snack. I have already recommended them to a few friends!
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Mary R.,",07-Feb-19,This was the first time I tried this product and I loved it. I told all my family and friends about it. I had made soup by using the seaweed and the wasbi broth. I let a friend try the soup and they loved it. My kids like eating the seaweed as a snack and I do too
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Omaimah G.,",01-Jan-19,"I tried the spicy noodles. The noodles were thick like spaghetti, and I didn't like the flavor of the broth. I was also disappointed by the small package of crushed red pepper ( maybe if it contained a couple of dried Thai peppers, it would have added a little heat)."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"johanna B.,",04-Dec-18,it took me awhile to get to the store to obtain this product and it was well worth the wait. The seaweed snack sheets were a perfect crispness. The sea salt flavor was not too much and added to the experience. I will definitely be on the look out for some of the other flavors to try next.
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Denise D.,",05-Mar-19,I got the Korean Barbeque Ocean's Halo Seaweed Snack Sheets although it took me awhile going store to store to find. I imagined that they were so delicious and that was the reason they were always out. Just because I am not a fish person does not mean these are not fantastic snacks. I found that everyone else in my family just loved them and that's a big shout out to the dads who created them. I am glad my family enjoys something that is actually healthy and good for you!!!
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jen S.,",21-Jan-19,"I love seaweed snacks. I've purchased different versions from so many different places, and I can honestly say that I really enjoyed these and would purchase again. I tried the Wasabi and Sea Salt since those are the flavors I typically buy, and the wasabi was way better than other brands. The sea salt was on par, although the quality of the seaweed seemed better. Give these a try!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Samantha M.,",15-Nov-18,"After testing my free sample of Oceans Halo seaweed snack sheets in wasabi flavor, I was absolutely blown away with how delicious they are!!! It is the perfect snack if you are always on the go. The flavor is light not too fish or too spicy. I would highly recommend giving these a try."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"heather C.,",06-Dec-18,I really wanted to like the Oceans Halo seaweed snacks. I figured the sea salt is a safe bet. They were just okay. I wasn't overly impressed. I tried them plain and then again added to a salad. They were better when added to my salad. I don't think I would purchase these.
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Brittany F.,",08-Dec-18,I really enjoyed the Ocean's Halo seaweed snacks. A few years back I never thought I would like the taste of seaweed and never thought I would willingly choose it as a snack. I tried the sea salt flavor and thought it had just the right amount of salt to make it delicious!
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Beau K.,",19-Dec-18,I love seaweed snacks and these were one of the better ones (normally I get whatever's cheapest.) It was flaky but not in the way that makes your whole mouth dry out. My boss also loves these and their broth bases. I did struggle to find them in my area though. I want to try chili lime next.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"claurie R.,",25-Nov-18,"The store I went to only had 2 flavors, original and bacon. I grabbed 2 bacon for my son and I. We both very much enjoyed them. Something I can grabbed for work as an in between snack, something fun for my son to snack on. Now a regular buy at my house!"
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Beth G.,",18-Nov-18,"The texture was very nice, it was very light and airy. I liked the thin crispness. The sea salt flavor was very salty in a really good way. The salt was very good. I would really like these, but I don't like the taste of nori. It tastes really fishy to me. The bacon flavor only seemed to add to the fishyness. The sea salt one starts out tasting really good, but then the salt melts away and if tastes like fish. These are almost good."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"R A.,",13-Jan-19,"These seaweed snacks were very hard to find. They were not at the stores listed. As a result I had to go about 10 miles away to find them. I did try the Sea Salt snacks. I enjoyed them. In fact, I recommended them to my vegan niece. However, due to the price and the distance to find them it is doubtul that I would be buying them. I am looking forward to using the coupons for the other products. I keep the coupons in my car in case I travel and know that I can find these products at stores further away."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Mionna K.,",28-Nov-18,"Yummy. I try to eat healthier these days, and finding snacks that are healthy and good tasting are hard to find. Luckily, I found these they're great and I can get my snack on. The variety is good so I'll have different options for different cravings. Will purchase more."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Shannon D.,",04-Jan-19,"I just had to try the Wasabi one! And it did not disappoint! This is such an awesome snack! I didn't really know what to expect, but I was so glad I tried it! I found a new favorite snack! It's one of those snacks that once you start, you can't put it down!"
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Asia G.,",24-Nov-18,"I was expecting something flavorful considering the flavors I've chosen, but I was sadly disappointed. I came into this testing with optimism and positivity, so I could give an open and honest review. It was either bland, not spicy enough, too salty or taste nothing like the flavor I chose. The healthy version of these snacks didn't meet my standards."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Marci G.,",26-Jan-19,"WHAT DID I THINK IF OF OCEANS HALO SEAWOOD SNACKS, I LOVED THEM.I TRIED THE WASABI AND SEA SALT FLAVORS. I LOVE HOW LIGHT AND CRISPY THEY ARE. REMINDS ME OF JAPENSE RICE CANDY. IT DISSOLVES IN YOUR MOUTH. I DONT HAVE TO MANY FRIENDS WHO LIKE OR CHOOSE A HEALTHIER LIFESTLY, THEREFORE I RECOMMENDED TO MY FAMILY. ALREADY, MY SISTER IS A FAN. I WILL BE BUYING THEM AGAIN. NO QUESTION. A GREAT PRODUCT. A VERY CONVENIENT AND HEALTYY SNACK"
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Elena H.,",15-Dec-18,"Thin ,light , subtle crunch. Perfect if you just want a little snack on something. We crumbled it on top of rice and it was really good that way. My son and husband didn't like them but I'm familiar with seaweed snacks and I really enjoyed them. I liked the chili lime but I was hoping to find the sriracha. I'll keep my eyes open. I would recconmend but I wouldn't buy them unless I was really craving it."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Sondra C.,",17-Nov-18,"These were tasty, savory,healthy and delicious. I loved the Korean bbq and Maui onion flavors. They are very handy to keep in a desk drawer or bag for a quick burst of nutrition. Seaweed is so good for you, rich in iodine. I would definitely buy these again."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Christina S.,",11-Dec-18,Amazing! I am already a fan of seaweed snacks but was in shock when I saw Ocean's Halo had so many options. I love the wide variety of flavors that were offered and the variety of over all products. Taste and texture were on point. I will be buying again for snacks on the go.
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Violet P.,",11-Mar-19,"I enjoyed seaweed snacks, but had never tried this brand before. Grabbed both the bacon and the sea salt flavors - was thinking I'd like the bacon better (it's hard to go wrong with bacon), but actually liked the plain version better. Both had good flavor, but the bacon ones had a gritty mouthfeel that I didn't really care for. Otherwise, no complaints about either... price was decent, serving size works, and they stay crisp until the package is open for a bit."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Debbie H.,",15-Nov-18,"I have never tried any type of Seaweed product before and figured it was something I would not care for. Let me tell you, the sea salt variety is awesome. Crispy, thin and with a nice saltiness. I'm trying to lose weight and these are a great snack product to use in place of potato chips and such."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"natasha B.,",25-Feb-19,I received a free sample of the new Ocean's Halo seaweed snack from #SocialNature to try and it wasn't for me some of my friends liked it and I still told people about them but the taste wasn't something I enjoyed everything is not for everyone I've always wanted to try seaweed for a while so I thought this would be perfect but I just don't like them the texture of them wasn't for me either but like I said but you might love them plus maybe it was just the flavor I got #TryNatural #GotItFree
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Robyn L.,",02-Nov-18,"I love this product! 100% natural premium seaweed in a convenient little package. Rich in trace minerals and vitamins. Great source of Iodine. No hassle-Ready to serve. Perfect size to carry in your bag for anytime snack. No Sugar, No Preservatives. No Cholesterol, No Trans Fat. Lightly salted with natural sea salt. wonderful nutty flavor. I definitely recommend it!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Brandy A.,",07-Nov-18,"These are excellent! I've always been a fan of the flavor of nori in sushi, but never thought to try it separately. I was excited when I came across these snacks! They have that classic nori, ocean flavor but with a little kick to make it exciting! Very thin and lightly crunchy. Almost like a super healthy snack chip. Even my kids enjoyed them!"
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Catrina D.,",26-Nov-18,"These are so good! I used them two ways, one I used them just as chips or a snack, they were crunchy and low carb so it works for people like me who follow keto! I also used them in a pho broth/soup for some texture, the chili lime are my favorite and I will be recommending these to all my low carb people! Give them a try you won't be disappointed"
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Courtney J.,",31-Oct-18,"These seaweed snacks were pretty good, but only get 4 stars because maybe it was where I got it at? But these have a very strong and salty aftertaste. Otherwise, very flavorful, great flavor choices, and you get just enough in each package for a healthy, nutritious snack (or whenever you have a salty craving!)."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Kerry M.,",10-Nov-18,I redeemed my free coupon for the Sea Salt Seaweed Snacks and they were DELICIOUS! So crunchy and light with still packing good flavor in them. I love that they are all natural and taste amazing. They have definitely found a happy home in my rotation of snacks and I can't wait to try the other flavors! I also redeemed a coupon for a Teriyaki Sauce which was also delightful. I made a Stir Fry and it wasn't an overpowering sauce and I love that it contained zero soy - it's impossible to find these days!
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Andrea S.,",07-Jan-19,"These Organic Seaweed Snacks by Ocean's Halo were delish! I really enjoy seaweed snacks and I was impressed with all of the flavor choices that Ocean's Halo offers! I opted to try the Chili Lime flavor for my free product from SocialNature. It was really good, and I look forward to trying additional flavors!"
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"George T.,",20-Jan-19,I enjoyed the Ocean's Halo Miso Noodle Bowl. Everything needed came in the package. The ingredients were easy to put together in the cute enclosed plant fiber bowl. I would have liked more tofu. The packet could have fit twice as much. The noodles come out al dente at the recommended microwave cooking time. It was tasty. I will probably buy again but microwave a little longer. @socialnature #GotItFree #trynatural
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Lan L.,",08-Dec-18,"It was so tasty, I especially liked the texture of the seaweed. It was crunchy, yet chewy. I liked that is is made with sustainable seaweed and non-GMOs. I hope to try more flavors in the future, but the price is a bit high for me to buy it very often."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jeannette W.,",06-Nov-18,"I finally found these products and tried the koren bbq. The taste was amazing. Im not usually into this type of food, but this is really good. I love that it's made with quality natural ingredients. It's a healthy snack that doesn't have the same bland taste and off texture that some do."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"marti W.,",27-Nov-18,Received a package of coupons from Social Nature to Sample and Review this product. I actually liked both the Ramen Noodles and their Stir Fry Sauce. The Stir Fry Sauce is enough for three (3) or four (4) servings. The taste is mild and not overpowering. I would recommend these to anyone. When purchasing this product again - I found that they have many flavors to choose from. I also saw many snacks chips that they had. I am impressed by this company and their line of products.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jenifer G.,",15-Nov-18,"I honestly think it was not that yummy...although my 5 year old daughter loved it. She ""tried"" a bite then took it and ate the entire thing. My personal opinion is why I only gave 3/5. Healthy and loved by my daughter though, that's why I changed my 3/5 to a 5/5. My daughter loves varied food and she wants more of these snacks!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Heather T.,",06-Jan-19,"I really liked this seaweed snack. It was a unique and healthy way to snack with a great taste too! I liked that it was light, a taste of spicy, salty and crunchy. I like the texture and would recommend to those that like this kind of adventurous snack."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Paige A.,",11-Mar-19,I thought the taste of these was pretty decent. Typically seaweed is kind of bland but the flavor variety these come in really add to the overall flavor. The only thing I didn't like was the package. I wish it came in a resealable package of some kind so that it wasn't just open until I finished it.
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Carl G.,",14-Nov-18,Organic Seaweed Snacks by Ocean's Halo in the Sea Salt flavor was very delicious. I made Musubi with it and everyone loved it. The Ocean's Halo Organic Seaweed Snacks was a big hit with all my friends and family. I would recommend the Ocean's Halo Organic Seaweed Snacks to anyone wanting a great flavor added to healthy seaweed.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Shirin A.,",20-Feb-19,"I tried the Miso Noodle Bowl & I just loved the taste of these noodles! Everything you need comes in the box. It is super easy to prepare. The noodles came out al dente, just the way I like. I would definitely recommend & purchase this again! Thank you for the sampling opportunity! #trynatural #gotitfree"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Claudia V.,",05-Dec-18,"I love seaweed and these snacks were no exceptions. I tried simple flavor, sea salt and they really hit the spot. I'm a lover of savory treats and these were yummy just by themselves. Next time I plan on adding them to soup or other foods, but for my first try I wanted to try them plain and get a good taste for them. They were amazing!!"
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Dane H.,",06-Dec-18,"We couldn't find many of the Ocean's Halo products, so I'd say that's my biggest negative. We really wanted to try to ramen bowls, but they're not at local grocery stores. (we tried 5 different stores). In the end we ended up just grabbing the seaweed snacks in the Korean BBQ flavor. These aren't a snack I would typically gravitate too, however they did taste decent."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Janet B.,",21-Jan-19,These are so good! It's hard to describe the flavor to someone who has never tried it before. I had tried plain seaweed snacks years ago and wasn't very impressed at that time. I tried the chili lime and hadly recommend them! I can't wait to try some other flavors. #trynatural #GotItFree
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Paula R.,",14-Nov-18,"I tried the Sea Salt Organic Seaweed snack and found it to be both delicious & nutritious, but not filling. It's not a meal replacement, but if you're hungry an hour before dinner, it's a pretty good snacking option that you can feel good about eating."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Stacy A.,",21-Jan-19,"I have to say that I was a little hesitant to try these. We are trying very hard to eat healthy and I'm missing salty snacks. The sea salt seaweed snacks curbed my cravings perfectly. They are absolutely delicious, they're not even gone yet, but they're already on my shopping list so that I don't run out!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"TRACY O.,",14-Jan-19,"Absolutely delish'! I highly recommend these! My kids are very ""picky"" healthy snackers', and they totally loved them! I ended up buying 3 of the four flavors and keep them stocked in the cabinet. Additionally, nailed the BBQ flavor without it being overwhelming!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Brenda C.,",23-Nov-18,"These are really tasty but not very filling. They satisfy the need when you are craving a crunchy snack. They are nothing like the thick nori seaweed that is used to wrap sushi that sometime can be tough and chewy. These are really thin and more crispy. They are a bit like eating flattened cotton candy, you just put one in your mouth, there is a bit of a crunch and then they really dissolve into next to nothing. They kind of seem like just a medium to deliver spices, which taste good. Spicy but not really spicy."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Emily B.,",24-Nov-18,"I didn't really like the texture or taste, but that's probably just because this product wasn't for me. I never really liked seaweed but wanted to try a new flavor. I still didn't really like it. I think others would like it though, if this is something you're into!"
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Misty B.,",28-Nov-18,"I bought these seaweed snacks as a healthy snack for my littles and myself. While they were decent in flavor, I just couldn't get past the texture of them. I love seaweed salad and am always willing to try new things, these just weren't for me. I'll pdobably try again and I've already recommended them to a few friends. Love oceans halo and their products!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Kendra S.,",17-Dec-18,I liked the taste/flavor of the seaweed snack. I tried both the sea salt and Maui onion and both were delicious. I would not really have expected that something this healthy would taste so good. It will likely become my go to snack now instead of chips and other unhealthy options.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Hollie N.,",04-Nov-18,"These were so much better than I expected. I've tried seaweed snacks before & they just always taste too fishy and too salty. But the Ocean's Halo Seaweed Snacks were delicious! They didn't taste overly fishy or salty and I used them as wraps. I filled them with tuna, lettuce, green onions & a soy dressing I make & they were so good! My entire family gobbled them up. I tried the Chili Lime and am excited to try the other flavors! Such a healthier & unique alternative to sandwiches & tortilla wraps. Love them!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Val B.,",07-Dec-18,"I have recived a sample of Organic seaweed snacks by Oceans Halo and I'm in love of them perfect snack before soccer and even after , we try to spicy chili lime , super crispy , and flavorful, it didn't taste like the other brand super salty and pretty ocany , Halo kept the seaweed flavored but not overwhelming my kids loves it, I loved , my kids where shocked we can eat seaweed on the normal basis not need to wait for sushi"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Dawn S.,",08-Dec-18,I never thought sea weed could taste so yummy! I love the fact that it I can enjoy a super tasty snack and not feel guilty! I am so glad I can take with me wherever I go when I have a craving for something crunchy! Thank you for giving such a wide variety of flavors to choose from! The bacon flavor is my favorite! Who ever thought bacon and sea weed would make a fantastic combination!
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Ruby R.,",26-Dec-18,"These are really tasty but not very filling. They are mainly just for snacking. Since the whole tray only contains 14oz of food.If you have never had them, they are nothing like the seaweed that is used to wrap sushi that sometimes can be tough and chewy. These are really thin and more crispy. Out of all the seaweed i've had these are the best so far. I would highly recommend."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Zoe G.,",15-Nov-18,I love anything bacon. So to have a healthy snack that has the flavor of bacon just minus the fat that Bacon has makes me happy. I didn't think any of my of my kids would try this type of snack since it was made from seaweed but but 13 year old son liked them a lot and so did my 9 year old daughter. I will definantly being buying them again and will keep you guys l posted on how the other flavors are. #GOTITFREE
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Kate K.,",19-Nov-18,seaweed snacks were small and crumbly but I find they make very good topping for chicken in the oven and sprinkled on ramen. I would advise a new texture so they don't crumble into little pieces when they are in the bag on the shelf. All the packages were full of broken pieces not one single big piece. Although that may also be the fault of the stock persons who crush the bags. They were really surprisingly tasty I did not think I would like them that much. Super healthy and def something I would like to munch on again.
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Carema H.,",19-Dec-18,"I enjoyes the ocean's halo sea salt. It is something I have never had before. I had to let all my friends and my family know that this product is good and I also let them know how healthy they are for a snack. You can take for lunch, for school or work, and even put in your purse for a snack for when your out doing something. #oceanshalo ""socialnature #free"
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Julie M.,",19-Nov-18,I was fully expecting not to like this as I have tried a seaweed snack by a different company previously and disliked it. This was pretty good though. The smell is overpowering. And it makes for a relatively healthy snack. My husband was a real fan of it though.
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Sascha W.,",25-Nov-18,"I tried the Miso Noodle Bowl and I was not impressed. It took a lot longer for the noodles to soften up than the directions suggested. It was bland, not that I expect miso soup to have a ton of flavor, but what flavor this one did have was slightly bitter. When I have miso soup I expect it to be savory and salty, and this just didn't do it for me. Also, it's a lot of packaging, and not much food for the price."
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Hollie S.,",27-Nov-18,"I was very curious to try these seaweed snacks. I thought maybe it could be a healthy go to snack. I was wrong. These things taste like your eating dried up fish skin. If you like sushi, you might like these, the taste is similar to the wrap of a sushi roll. It makes a lot of crumbs and just did not impress me."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Chris W.,",10-Nov-18,"We tried the sea salt first.. and my husband was the first to try (we have never had seaweed snacks before) and he was not impressed. His words were it tastes like a fish tank smells.. me personally thought it was pretty grassy. The bacon flavor was a bit better and gave a hit of better that a fish tank. All in all I know some really liked them, and I will recommend others try them out, but for us.. we will pass."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Austin T.,",31-Oct-18,"I loved the fact that it is all natural and a sustainable food that tastes good. I bought the chili lime flavor,and I'll definitely be back for more,the lime cuts the spice down a little but it still has all the flavor of the chili peppers and it has a nice crunch that is just more satisfying than potato chips."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Robin D.,",06-Jan-19,These were SOOOOOOOOOO GOOOOODDDDD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I hadn't tried seaweed before but I was curious. So when these were sent to me in the mail I was excited and so pleasantly surprised. It's like a salty potato chip that melts on your tongue. I could eat them all day.
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Tal H.,",28-Oct-18,"I received a coupon for a free Ocean's Halo Organic Seaweed Snack Sheets pack and tried the Sea Salt flavor. It was really delicious and satisfied my craving for something salty to munch on. I love that it provides a healthy and nutritious alternative to snacking on pretzels and chips. I am looking forward to trying the other great sounding flavors, particularly Korean Barbeque! My kids also really enjoyed the seaweed snacks and it's a snack that I felt good about sharing with them! It will definitely be added to their school snack rotation!"
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Misty H.,",06-Nov-18,"So much better than other brands which I e tried. They don't have that weird want to gag funky after taste and my kids loved to dip then in salsa as well as French onion dip. They also leave you filling satisfied without feeling stuffed and groggy. It's nice knowing I ate something that's wholesome as well as great for all aspects of my mind, body, and lifestyle. The kids wanted more so I've already bought two additional flavors and can't wait until we try them all."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Caitlin D.,",26-Nov-18,"I was a bit skeptical, especially after opening the package to find strange green, paper-like sheets of - snacks? But - they're SO GOOD!! I'm on a low carb diet and since I don't want to eat chips, these are a great healthy alternative when you're looking for salty and crispy. Recently seaweed has become a favorite snack!"
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Haru B.,",15-Nov-18,"To start off, the seaweed snack, in general, are not for everyone. Some people just do not like seaweed snacks. I do prefer them and think that these are a very good option. The consistency and flavor are as advertised but a few pieces were stale like for some reason. Overall, this product meets expectations, I would recommend it!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Chelsea G.,",04-Nov-18,"This was much better than expected! The flavor was bold and tasty and you could still taste the yummy Seaweed! I think this would be wonderful to take to work with me for a snack or an addition to my lunch! I ate it as soon as I got it, so ill try packing it next time!"
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Cindy W.,",19-Feb-19,"I tried the Bacon flavored organic seaweed snack. It was used as just a snack. I have never tried any seaweed snack products before and was curious about how it tasted. It did have a bacon flavor, however, the texture was different. It seems like something I might try again. Maybe try the Sea Salt or get the Wasabi and let my husband try it out. I also got the noodles and I did like them a lot. I used the noodles for a chicken stir fry and it was pretty good. I have already told some friends and family members about it and they thought they would also try it out."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Vanessa M.,",12-Dec-18,I had the great opportunity to try Ocean Halo seaweed snacks through Social Nature. I tried the bacon and the sea salt flavors. Oh my goodness they were so good. This product is great for a snack but I also tried them with rice. Yes I know there for a snack but the versatility of this little snack is awesome for me. The flavor was great lite not over powering. The packaging is very bright and colorful. I have purchased some of the other flavors to try not only because they are so good but because this product brand is not expensive it's very easy on the pocket book. Oh and i really want to try making little sushi rolls and that's just one of mean ideas I have for this amazing little snack.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Sam R.,",26-Nov-18,"I love seaweed snacks, but they're often either not seasoned enough or too seasoned. Ocean's Halo's Korean BBQ were so gosh dang delicious. It was almost like enjoying super thin jerky. They're a few cents more expensive than other brands, but the variety is worth it. Btw, I got this for free via SocialNature < 3"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Karen H.,",30-Nov-18,I was hesitant with trying a seaweed based snack at first. These were very different from any other snacks I'd ever tried though. The flavor selection was interesting and I tried the sea salt flavor. I thought they were very good and they added a healthier snack option for me.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Sandy N.,",11-Nov-18,The Ocean's Halo Seaweed Snacks were a surprisingly very tasty snack! My family and I enjoyed the Texas BBQ and Bacon flavor. Definitely a very healthy alternative to the regular snacks that aren't healthy! I would absolutely recommend Ocean's Halo Seaweed Snacks to everyone and thank you Social Nature for allowing me to try this!!
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Stefani M.,",01-Nov-18,I tried a couple different varieties of the seaweed as well as seaweed with chocolate interestingly enough this evening and the chocolate complemented each other very well. I definitely found myself reaching for more even though I knew the bag was empty! Dried seaweed with a little salt is one of my favorite snacks for; I am absolutely partial to it! I tasted the sea salt as well as the wasabi both were quite enjoyable.
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Shontae T.,",19-Nov-18,"FLAVOR: Maui Onion flavor --- PROS: The flavor was good. I would describe the flavor as ""sweet onion with a hint of bbq sauce"". CONS: It is a seasoned a little too much for me, so much so that it covered up the nori taste. USES: Sparingly - I would most likely snack on this flavor in a combination with the plain or sea salt flavored nori. RECOMMENDATION: I would recommend this flavor for anyone trying nori snacks for the 1st time and/or is a fan of sweet onion flavors."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Amelia L.,",06-Dec-18,Really tasty and not messy to eat on the go. Loved the taste it did not taste like you were eatting anything other than a bbq chip. I would highly recoomend these to anybody! Next I want to try the bacon! So heres the deal. AMAZING! TRY! TRY! TRY! TRY! I am a picky eater and I will dedintally go buy again. Maybe after this review is posted . So go buy these. Stop reading this review! Go now! NOW!!!!
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jennifer R.,",17-Dec-18,"I bought the regular sea salt seaweed snack pack. I loved the flavor that the sea salt added, but didn't think it was too salty, like you'd expect it to be. I ate this plain, and thought the crunchy textured was great since it wasn't too soft or bendy like other brands I've tried in the past. I would definitely buy this again, since I'm pretty picky about seaweed snacks!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"darla P.,",06-Dec-18,I have always been a huge fan of Ocean's Halo seaweed snack. I have had so many different kinds and they all taste just like salt and seaweed instead of the marketed flavor. The Korean BBQ is good with the sweet tang which is a refreshing flavor for me when it comes to seaweed snacks. Really great for the price! I've been looking everywhere for good flavored seaweed and finally found it.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Debbie N.,",28-Nov-18,I never heard of it before until family member told me so I tried it when they gave me some of it and then when I got my sample I tried it and I loved it it has a unique taste but it was delicious I like all natural in the ingredients was vantastic I already recommended to my co-workers and my family thank you so much and have a blessed day
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Shauna L.,",21-Dec-18,"The Oceans Halo Sea Salt Flavored Seaweed Snacks were pretty good. The had a decent flavor and believe it or not my 16 year old daughter liked them the most out of the entire family. The one problem I had was not with the product itself but actually the availability of the product and access to finding it in any stores in my area.I had to visit 8 different stores before I was able to find the product to even try it out. But, as far as the actual Seaweed Snacks, I find they are a great healthy snack for my family."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jen M.,",08-Nov-18,"I was really excited to try these. This was my first experience trying a seaweed snack, I tried the sea salt flavor. I have to say it wasn't my favorite snack, the texture was a little strange to me and I didn't love the flavor. It has nothing to do with the Brand, seaweed snacks are just not for me!"
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Tosha H.,",25-Nov-18,I actually enjoyed this product. The fact that's it's organic is perfect for me. It's basically a healthy tasty snack that I truly enjoyed. I would definitely recommend this. I was worried if I would like it are not but when I tried it I couldn't stop eating it. It was very tasty and crisp and satisfying.
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Alexa L.,",11-Nov-18,"These were really yummy and make a healthy, low-calorie, alternative snack that fits easily in a lunch bag. My preferred way to eat them is rolled up with a little bit of cream cheese and slice of avocado. The Chili Lime and Wasabi flavors made this simple combination interesting and introduced some variety to my family's snacking options. They're also fantastic crunched up on top of rice bowls, ramen, scrambled eggs, and stir-fried veggies. The price point is pretty much on-par with other brands, however Ocean's Halo has the added benefit of being sustainable and non-GMO, which is very important to me. I'll definitely be a return customer! Such a great way to satisfy a craving for something salty and savory with minimal guilt!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"KT B.,",08-Dec-18,I've never tried a product like this before and I was a little hesitant but to my surprise these were pretty good! Much Bette than expected and I will be recommy these to friends and family and adding them to my grocery list when I need a super healthy snack!
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Alison G.,",26-Nov-18,I normally buy my seaweed snacks at a traditional Asian market. The packages aren't in English but you know you're getting something good. I'm happy to say Ocean's Halo Seaweed Snacks are just as good and I feel better knowing exactly what's in my snacks.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Rebecca W.,",15-Nov-18,"The Ocean's Halo Sea Salt Seaweed Snack was amazing, it had just hint of sea salt to make my taste buds do a little dance. I enjoyed them with sushi rice and kimchi and to say it was most satisfying is an understatement! This are my new go to for snacking!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Sarah H.,",07-Dec-18,"I purchased the Ocean's Halo Seaweed Snacks in the Bacon Flavor and the Sea Salt Flavor. They really are a great addition to any meal, but especially for packing a lunch on-the-go. For me, the flavors were not incredibly strong, but I did slightly notice them. It's a nice feeling when you are snacking, and you know that you are eating something healthy. I would recommend trying them, especially since they are very affordable. If you like seaweed in general, I think that you will not be disappointed with an array of additional flavors to try!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"odile S.,",28-Oct-18,"Where to start!. I picked up the item thinking, oh well, another seaweed snack. Oh nooo!, this seaweed snack is the best of the best. The sheets seems ticker than the usual, it was fresh, crispy, meaning melting without getting stuck on the roof of your mouth. I bought 2 and gave 1 to a friend and she was also sold. The only con is the package is not enough for a snack, lol. Too good, you'll need 2."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Rakeeah T.,",06-Dec-18,So I was chosen to try this brand of seaweed chips by Oceans Halo and here is what I thought. The texture of the snacks resembles kale chips...a little weird! However the flavor I chose to try was chili lime and it tastes pretty good. What I like most about the product is that there are 7 different flavors to try and it is non-gmo. What I like the least a about it is the texture. I see myself purchasing the snacks in the future only because food is all about flavor to me and not about texture and their are six other flavors for me to try. I would still recommend this product to my family and friends as something new and different to try.
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Lita N.,",09-Dec-18,"I've tried this product before in a different flavor (Sriracha), this time I tried Sea Salt (it was the only flavor in stock at my local grocery and I'm starting to see why) and I have to say that the flavor that I just tried wasn't exactly great in my opinion. Sure, one should be expecting much from a flavor like Sea Salt when it applies to something like sea weed, but this was by far the saltiest sea weed I've ever tried! I drank over half a bottle of water and still felt parched! I don't recommend eating this on its own. Adding it to ramen or maybe some kind of rice bowl is fine, but if you try to eat it on its own, expect to be chugging down to get the saltiness out of your mouth. The sea weed is very pronounced and is constantly at odds with the equally powerful sea salt flavor. Try it if you dare."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Patricia F.,",10-Nov-18,"We absolutely loved it! We were sceptical about seaweed, but the taste of bacon was the perfect pitch. It's not hard to chew or swallow. it is a true flavorful snack. Easy to take anywhere and lots of flavors. Healthy snacking at it's best. My son ask for more!!!!! Thank you ocean's halo!"
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jami S.,",04-Jan-19,"I am on the fence on Ocean Halo Seaweed Snacks. I got the Sea Salt, and it wasn't what I expected. It tasted better than I thought it would, but it still wasn't something I would eat as a snack everyday. Maybe some of the other flavors would be more flavorful than the Sea Salt. It is a healthy alternative to other snacks, and if I go on a diet I might pick these over an unhealthy snack. Until then, I will keep my current snack."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Julia S.,",26-Nov-18,So delicious! And suprisingly a great price. I'll be buying these as an alternative for snacking. Thank you for the opportunity to try these. Ive always loved trying new foods and this was not a disappointment. I love sushi and wasabi. Ski a Seaweed treat with wasabi flavor was right up my alley.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Sandra G.,",28-Oct-18,I am giving Ocean's Halo seaweed snack 3 stars. The snack is paper thin and pretty much melts on your tongue. It is slightly fishy tasting which was a turn off for me altogether. I will say that I purchased 2 different flavors. The sea salt which was most fishy. Also the bacon which was not quite as fishy and the bacon canceled it out. My son and husband also tried it and they both liked it. My son said it reminded him slightly of sushi which he is also a fan of and I am not. My son preferred the sea salt and my husband preferred the bacon. They would probably give it a 5. In fact while at the store today my son bought 2 more. I guess you will have to try it for yourself. If I had to choose a favorite it would be the bacon.
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Elizabeth S.,",30-Oct-18,"I really liked these seaweed snacks. The texture is a little strange at first, but once you get used to it - it's very fun to eat. The wasabi flavor is great, and it really satisfied a craving for me. I would tell a friend to try them- for a tasty snack you can feel good about."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Joanna R.,",24-Nov-18,"Halo Organic Seaweed Snacks are so good!!..... Right out of the bag yummy.... But, decided to make a fish soup...after we served ourselves some soup we cut up the Ocean's Halo Sea Salt Organic Seaweed Snacks and mixed them in to the soup....The snacks gave the soup such a pop of flavor.....can't wait to try the rest of the Ocean's Halo Organic Seaweed Snacks!!!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Kayla C.,",07-Jan-19,I absolutely loved these seaweed products. I purchased the chili lime as this is my first choice and loved it. And I reluctantly purchased the bacon seaweed but I was surprised that it actually tasted good. I will continue to purchase seaweed products from this brand.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Gabrielle D.,",21-Jan-19,"I love salty, crunchy snacks like chips and crackers, but I'm trying to eat fewer carbs and processed foods for health reasons. These Ocean's Halo seaweed snacks definitely scratch the itch and taste delicious too! I like that you can actually taste the flavors, unlike other brands' seaweed snacks, and they feel more crispy too ( less oily and not so heavy on the sesame flavor). Maui onion and KBBQ are my favorites, but even the plain ones are tasty."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Josh P.,",05-Nov-18,"I really enjoyed this light little treat. At first I wasn't so sure as eating seaweed does not sound enjoyable at all. However even just the plain Sea Salt flavor gave it the perfect taste of salty and yet slightly sweet. A perfect savory snack, though the price was a little high, and wasn't something I would fill up on easily."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"erin M.,",18-Nov-18,"A huge thank you to SocialNarure for the coupon to get a free Ocean's Halo Organic Seaweed Snack! I wasn't to sure about these at first, it's definitely not a product I would've chosen without this coupon. I got the sea salt flavor and was very surprised at how great these taste, I have already bought more of them and excited to try some of the other flavors. They offer a pretty good selection of flavors, most of them I can see myself trying. These are perfect for me to snack on between meals instead of my normal unhealthy snacks I usually eat."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Kimberly K.,",25-Feb-19,They were very tasty. I wasn't sure how they were going to taste considering that they were made from sea weed. I like the crunch. They weren't too crunchy that they hurt the inside of my mouth like some potato chips. The nutritional value and taste were unexpectedly good. The Texas BBQ and the Korean BBQ flavors were good. I would like to try some of the others also.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Abigail V.,",04-Dec-18,"I tried the sea salt seaweed snack, and they sure do have a strong taste! I'd never tried seaweed snacks before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. They definitely have a strong fishy smell and taste, so not for the faint of heart or taste buds. Overall, they were a fun snack to try, but not something that I would purchase again."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Sonya W.,",14-Jan-19,"My experience with the Ocean's Halo Seaweed Snack Sheets was definitely different! I've never had a snack like this & they're so convenient. Not to mention, all the Great Variety of Flavors for everyone's enjoyment. Plus I love that they're made of Non-GMO!!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Debbie F.,",11-Mar-19,"I thought that Ocean's Halo Organic Seaweed Snacks were different. They weren't bad, they were good which really surprised me. It was VERY good. I am going to buy them again and again..(I have bought more already) my husband loves them, also. I recommend this healthy snack to everyone that wants a healthier snack alternative."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Michele S.,",09-Nov-18,This is my favorite seaweed now! The flavor was just right with just the proper amount of saltiness. I love the fact that this product is made with sustainable ingredients and is non-GMO. I would definitely get it again and recommend this product and brand to friends and family.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Angie B.,",27-Nov-18,"I wasn't sure I'd like this, but they are DELICIOUS! So much better than a potato chip! I tried the chili lime....perfection!! Eating healthy is my goal and these are going to make it easier to stay on track with the variety of flavors they offer! Can't wait to try them all!!!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Holly H.,",16-Feb-19,Oceans Halo products are awesome! I have tried a variety within the last 2 months and every single flavor is scrumptious. Love that fact they are non-gmo. Even my picky nine year old loves the sea salt snack sheets! I feel very good knowing that these are healthy alternative for a snack.
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Ona A.,",21-Jan-19,Definitely the better brand for seaweed snacks that I have tried before. My kids did not enjoy them as much as some other brands but still seemed to enjoy them. I will try a couple more flavors before giving up on this brand. Great packaging and good price for the quality.
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jordan H.,",26-Nov-18,"At first, I was rather skeptical about the idea of eating seaweed. I had only done that by getting sushi from the buffet line at Chinese restaurants. However, when I actually tried it, I was very pleasantly surprised by the delicious taste. Not only did it not have any overwhelmingly fishy taste, but the bacon flavor was very authentic too. If I have one critique, it would be that the snack size is rather small and unsatisfying, but the flavor is far beyond what I would have thought possible. I am not sure if it is so good that I would tell a friend about them, but I would certainly get them again myself."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"robin D.,",17-Nov-18,"I bought the sea salt flavor, and I really liked it! It was salty but not too much. They were very crunchy so it felt like I was eating chips. I like the size of the package because if it was bigger it would be easy to eat too many at once. I will definitely buy them again."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"D D.,",22-Nov-18,"This brand remains difficult to hunt down where I live. But it was worth it. I tried the Sea Salt flavor, and really liked it. Seaweed is a surprisingly great snack, it's much milder in a sense than I would expect, but still has that sea-veggie taste that I like in things like maki and miso soup. They also have a satiating quality, even though you don't seem like you are eating much. I think I may try these as a sandwich ingredient layered with other stuff, or in a tuna or shrimp wrap."
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Amanda A.,",26-Oct-18,"I didn't like it at all. The seaweed tasted too fishy. As my sister said, "" it tastes like those fish food flakes I would sneak eat when I was a kid."" I couldn't even finish one of the chips. I don't like seafood though, so that may have been a factor in my displeasure."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Shelby D.,",01-Dec-18,I was surprised to see that Ocean's Halo had so many different flavours for their seaweed snack sheets! I honestly had a hard time deciding which one to try. I got the chili lime this time... Next time I'll have a hard time choosing between the Texas BBQ and the Korean BBQ or bacon.. So many good choices!
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Lora D.,",11-Feb-19,"Love the taste, just a hint of wasabi! Only 20 calories per package! Great snack for any low carb lifestyle! These are really thin and more crispy. They are a bit like eating flattened cotton candy, you just put one in your mouth, there is a bit of a crunch and then they really dissolve into next to nothing. I wish they were less expensive."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Lindsey Y.,",26-Nov-18,"Love, love, love this!!!! It's a great snack for on the go and incredibly addictive!!! I literally almost ate the whole package in one sitting. The seaweed is so thin and crispy and the flavor is to die for. I can not wait to open up another package."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Sydney R.,",22-Nov-18,I used it as a snack and was very impressed! It had the perfect texture and taste that you would expect a good seaweed snack to have. There were a lot of flavors to pick from but I grabbed the sea salt so I could judge the actual seaweed and not just a yummy flavor. I will definitely be buying the other flavors!
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Julia S.,",28-Nov-18,"This product was delicious! The perfect amount of salty and crispy. I tired the sea salt flavor. I ate it on top of the Ocean's Halo ramen noodles that I prepared in a homemade broth with some veggies, chicken, and eggs. It was delicious! Not as oily as some other seaweed snacks that I have tried, which I loved."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Kayla H.,",21-Nov-18,"This is actually pretty good. Ibwas not expecting to enjoy it but it was pretty good. I tried the sea salt and the korean bbq. I wouldn't purchase these again although i have recommended them to a few people. They are worth trying because if the taste is what you like, I definitely thing you'd enjoy these!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Cha X.,",15-Dec-18,Light and crispy. Not too fishy nor salty. My kids like to wrap rice with the seaweed and it eat it or sometimes add some meat with the rice. They say they're making their own sushi and they love the seaweed. We enjoy eating it alot and wouldn't mind getting it again.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Cari C.,",15-Nov-18,Wasnt tpp impressee with the halo product. It was the wasabi. Just not something I would get again and eat again. It's actually not a bad price and it's perfect for people who like asian food. I will have to try another product by halo and see if I like it better. Maybe a different flavor. I wouod recommend it to people who like that kind of stuff. I'm glad I tried it though.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Clemence K.,",07-Dec-18,"This was one of the best seaweed snacks that I've tried so far. It doesn't leave an oily residue like most seaweed snacks. They were addicting to eat and will purchase another bag. Try the chili lime or sea salt flavor, you won't be disappointed! 5/5"
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Arianna I.,",30-Oct-18,"The sea salt flavor was a nice flavor and texture comparable to other seaweed snacks I've tried, e.g. store brands. The bacon, however, was really exiting and delicious. I was surprised to see it was vegan, because the sweet and smoky bacon flavor was so strong! I've never seen seaweed snacks like that before, and I'd gladly try them again. Delicious! Great for a crunchy treat!"
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Terry C.,",17-Nov-18,"I am not normally a big fan of seaweed products but I do try to eat a wide variety of foods that are healthy. These were a pretty good snack. Had them as a late morning bite to keep me going at work. Light but not too airy and just the right taste for my taste buds. With some green tea, made for a good , quick snack."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Monica F.,",27-Nov-18,"I tried the Chili Lime Seaweed Snacks. At first the thought of eating something from seaweed was a little scary. I live near the Gulf I know what seaweed looks like. These were pretty good. A little sour with a little spice. I got past the thought of seaweed and focused on taste and texture. Taste was great, the texture a little hard but o.k."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Christa H.,",24-Nov-18,"I was pleasantly surprised how good these were! The first bite took some getting used to because you expect for it to taste one way then BAM, flavor! It has a almost fishy smell to it and salty taste but it wasn't too overpowering or overwhelming it was just right. I'll have to try more flavors and varieties."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Morgan H.,",11-Dec-18,"I got the Texas BBQ flavor, and I'm not sure I liked it. I think it was the texture more than the flavor - because the flavor wasn't too bad! I am not used to seaweed, actually I think this may have been the first time I've eaten it. But I would give it a try again!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Geonna K.,",31-Oct-18,"I LOVED my free sample of the Maui Onion Oceans Halo Seaweed Snack , it hit the spot as a nice little treat. The taste was both sweet and salty and really tasted like almost onion chips. The texture was really crunchy and mimicked regular potato chips. These are a great substitute to potato chips and are honestly way better in my opinion , I highly suggest giving them a try."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Debbie B.,",31-Jan-19,"I love the Korean BBQ flavor,with my husbands being,chili lime. We eat seaweed,on a regular basis & Ocean's Halo seaweed snacks are top of the line,in snacking. Wonderful flavor,evenly distributed throughout the crispy chip. Our perfect,no cheat,go to snack. The Texas BBQ,is a favorite,of mine,as well."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Layna D.,",21-Nov-18,I tried a bag of the Ocean's Halo seaweed snacks not really knowing what to expect. The flavor wasn't too strong and not overly salty. I would try another bag in a different flavor next time. My only complaint was that there wasn't much of the snacks in the package.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"lei F.,",13-Nov-18,"I love seaweed (nori) in general, it was nice to see a few different flavors offered. I tried the wasabi flavored ones. It has a hint of wasabi taste and mild spiciness (when you eat wasabi). each piece was crunchy and then melted in your mouth. I would recommend this to any one."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Virginia G.,",27-Nov-18,"This is the first time I've tried this brand. I've buy the chili lime flavor and I was very surprised. The main thing is that they are organic, they really taste good, they are thin and crispy. I really did not expect that flavor i was impressed in this product."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Matilda P.,",24-Nov-18,I had never tried any type of seaweed snack before this so I wasn't sure if I would like it. I'm so glad I did because they where really good! We tried the chili lime flavor. My kids even enjoyed them as a snack. The seaweed snacks where crispy and had just the right amount of flavor added to it. We will be buying again!
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Marissa G.,",26-Nov-18,"I was a little nervous at the idea of eating seaweed, but these were surprisingly delicious! I tried both the bacon and the sea salt. I just ate them as on the go snacks, when I was hungry between meals. I would highly recommend that you try them, as you won't be disappointed. I can't wait to try the other flavors."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Emily B.,",26-Nov-18,"Ocean's Halo Veggie broth was a great change and new addition to my favorite wintertime veggie soup. I loved the added seaweed/sea vegetable flavor, it paired perfectly with my ginger, lemongrass, mushrooms, and spices. I will absolutely buy this again."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Miranda J.,",26-Oct-18,"These were pretty good. I tried the Korean BBQ flavor and the taste was definitely there- you still get that briny ocean flavor too. These are good for on the go and a great afternoon snack. The texture is really good, it can be difficult to get over the strong oceanic flavor in the background."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Sheena B.,",05-Nov-18,It's a salty snack other than chips. The saltiness is good. The texture is kind of fun. My niece and nephew will eat them. It wasnt my favorite. I thought it had a weird taste. But compared to other healthier salty snacks. I would choose those. I might try another flavor.
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"hollie M.,",07-Dec-18,"I was sceptical about trying Oceans Halo Organic Seaweed Snacks at first due to prior bad experiences with dried seaweed. I decided to purchase the sea salt flavor and as soon as I opened the package I was pleasantly surprised. The texture and color were both very appetizing not mushy and drab in color like many other brands I have sampled. The taste it self was great, it satisfied my cravings for both something crunchy and salty. I am looking forward to purchasing these in different varieties of flavors and keeping them on hand for a healthy, yummy snack!"
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"miwa I.,",12-Dec-18,"I chose ocean hall sea salt seaweed snack. (there are just 2choices; chili like or sea salt) I love seaweed. This product is thicker than I purchase at organic store. Taste bit week. Little bit more sea salt is better!! Good for snack or with meals. Specially, with cooked warm rice!!"
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Maria B.,",13-Nov-18,"Not a big fan of seaweed, have heard of health benefit, This was better than most I have tried inthis snack variety though Although the other flavor was great and you could tastet teh difference (we bought two kinds) the taste of the sea weed overall is just something I cannot get over. I had a friend I recommended ittoo and she did ike it though."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Susanne B.,",16-Feb-19,"I used the vegetable broth in a mushroom and onion stir fry and it gave it a richer flavor than simply using olive oil and salt. Since I am staying away from dairy, soy and gluten this product seems to agree with my digestive system which is always a great thing! I would have liked a bit stronger flavor since I don't use a lot of other spices so look forward to trying some of the other products."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Milo S.,",05-Nov-18,"Wow - finally found a crunchy and delicious snack that I don't feel guilty about eating! You know how bad you feel after eating regular processed potato chips? Kind of like an overweight slug, right? Leave those feelings today by buying these because they are amazing with dip and or cheese and they're not bad for you. Our friends love them."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Kalene C.,",24-Nov-18,"I really liked the flavor of the sea salt, it wasn't overbearing and very tasty! It was crispy and a great snack! I would definetly recommend this product to my friends and would buy again. I've shared the coupon already and a couple friends are ready to try it!"
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Vic W.,",18-Nov-18,"My daughter, husband,8year old granddaughter and I sat down while watching football to try the bacon and sea salt flavored seaweed chips. We liked the thin, crunchy texture and the fact that they were low-cal and good for you( you hear so much about the benefits of seaweed). We were expecting salty...like the ocean...,but we couldn't get past the fishy taste. The bacon ones were a bit better but after two or three everyone was overwhelmed by the fish taste. None of us would try them again even though we loved the health benefits and the light crunchiness."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Tabitha T.,",15-Nov-18,"It was very good enjoy eating it and love the fact ots healthier for my family. The taste was good and not to salty was surprised because most noodles are super salty not these just the right amount of flavor in them, my toddler loves eating noodles and loved them so , would recommend to try it out"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Luisa D.,",27-Nov-18,"Ocean's Halo veggie broth was delicious! I've tried a plethora of vegetable broths for soups, stews, curry, and other recipes and this has definitely been a crowd pleaser! The reduced sodium content compared to other supermarket broths was a major draw for me. The flavor was intense and it was great to know that what I would be eating was delicious and nutritious. I would highly recommend this product !!"
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Kathryn M.,",12-Feb-19,They weren't bad per say just not my thing. My sister loved them. Of course she is the weird that always raw seaweed. It just wasn't my thing. I would definently suggest trying it if your curious. From my family's reactions it was either a gimme gimme more or No thank you. It's worth a shot.
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"ren O.,",07-Dec-18,"Miso Halo soup is the complete package. It's not enough for a ""meal"" for me, however, it's a quick and satisfying snack to keep on hand both at home and in the office. Simple to prepare and put together and filling. Natural and tasty ingredients make me feel good about consuming."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jessica M.,",30-Dec-18,"Once I received my coupons (took a little bit of time to make it to my mailbox) I tried the sea salt seaweed snack and loved them! A light and refreshing snack. You definitely have to like the taste of seaweed (which I do) to enjoy these though. I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a light, healthy snack. I would like to try the other flavors: chili lime & Korean BBQ."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Richard E.,",07-Dec-18,"THE STORES SHOULD START SELLING THESE NEXT TO THE POTATO CHIPS. ONE, THERE ARE JUST AS MANY DIFFERENT FLAVORS. TWO, THEY ARE MUCH BETTER FOR YOU. IT IS A MUCH MORE SUSTAINABLE PRODUCT. PART OF THE PROCEEDS GOES TO CHARITY. THE ENTIRE PACKAGING IS BIODEGRADABLE. THIS IS THE SNACK FOOD OF THE 21ST CENTURY."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Kimberly A.,",16-Nov-18,"I tried bacon and sea salt flavors. The sea salt was amazing, salty, crispy-- a little weird tasting simply because seaweed isn't a staple of my diet, but a few slices in and I'm addicted. By the time I was at the end of the pack, I'm sad that it's ended! Bacon was also good, if a touch slick feeling. Still, very tasty and left me wanting more! (But maybe pack a napkin.) [Unfortunately, the store I went to only carried these two flavors: I would have loved to try Chili Lime, Korean BBQ, and Maui Onion as well!]"
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Svetlana B.,",05-Nov-18,"I went with the bacon flavor, the texture was strange like thin crispy paper, but I found I really enjoyed it. I am weird that way :). I have already recommend these to my friends. The product being healthy and organic is quite an added bonus. We will be purchasing more of these!! Will use my buy one get one free coupon on two more for sure."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Donna S.,",03-Nov-18,"These were great! Great, fresh flavor in a very light and healthy snack! I brought my two packages to my nursing clinicals and shared them with those who also enjoy these kinds of snacks...they were a huge hit! We can't wait to try the other flavors!"
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"MeLisa A.,",07-Dec-18,"I enjoy seaweed snacks. They're a great snack that fits Perfectly with my dietary needs. The Ocean's Halo seaweed snacks had ok flavor and were just a little on the chewy side for me. I would maybe still buy these considering the price, but I prefer other brands."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Margo S.,",08-Feb-19,"I really enjoy seaweed snack, so this wasn't my first time trying dried seaweed. The packaging is convient for on the go snacks, or portioned our snacks at home/work. I like that there's a variety of flavors to try, but classic sea sat is always the best in my mind. Crunchy and satisfying for a salt craving!"
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"MegHan M.,",07-Dec-18,"the G.I. Joe and i tried some snacks. very well packaged for lunches. i thought the taste was meh. the G.I. Joe said ""i expected it to taste like the ones ive had from korea?, with a little more flavor and crunch."" i would have liked to try another flavor but this was the only one carried at my store"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Ashleigh S.,",25-Nov-18,These little seaweed snacks are perfect! They are salty and crunchy and yummy and great for on the go or when you just need a little something! I love that there are several different flavors and that it's a snack that's healthier for me so I don't have to feel bad munching on it.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Verena K.,",31-Oct-18,"I tried the Miso Broth.This product was new to me but I liked it so much that I will get it again.My hubby and me used it for a soup,with onions,leeks,carrots and tofu in it and the taste was great! I would recommend this product because it also not so salty as the other broth products from this company."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Amilia S.,",10-Nov-18,"I decided to try the Korean BBQ flavor. I have tried seaweed snacks in the past and there was nothing really special about the flavor of them just eh. Only have ever seen sea salt flavors or just plain in the past. So having these flavor options was very nice! I decided to try something pretty similar to my favorite chip. BBQ flavor, and boy was I surprised! Very nice flavor payout but not too much! Tasty and might be a healthier option to the potato variety."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Mea C.,",20-Nov-18,"They were crispy and had a decent flavor - not at all ""fishy"" like I thought they'd be. I tried the bacon flavor and the Texas BBQ chips. The bacon didn't taste exactly like bacon. It wasn't unpleasant but it wasn't exactly bacon-y. The Texas BBQ was sweeter than expected. I liked them though."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Laura H.,",13-Jan-19,"It was not bad. They were hard for me to obtain, but they tasted ok. I got the sea salt variety which would probably been better if i wasnt such a confirmed poopato chip addict. They were crunchy and visually appealing. A co worker absolutely loved them. I personally wont be purchasing them."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Gail K.,",26-Feb-19,"I love social nature, I do not eat a thing bacon, I do not like pork, but I have found some new products on here, it was so tempting and I would love to try, I just had posted the new products on my face book page. I will try them and others will view my social nature products, and love them as much as I have, and will be tempted to try the products."
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Karen S.,",05-Dec-18,"The taste was too fishy for my liking. The store didn't have any other flavor than sea salt. Consistency was flaky but not much to crunch, I'd prefer a chip or cracker as a snack. Also seemed like excessive packaging for a single serving. Would not buy again"
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Janette C.,",06-Dec-18,"These snacks weren't for me. The packaging is attractive and I was excited to #TryNatural, I just don't think I'm a seaweed snack kind of gal. I enjoy the @OceansHalo brand and will continue to purchase their broths and noodles! #GotItFree Thanks @SocialNature"
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Maya W.,",12-Nov-18,"I redeemed the coupon for the Sushi Nori Full Seaweed Sheets, as the store I visited only had the Bacon and Sea Salt flavors available in the Seaweed Snacks and I wanted the Chili Lime flavor. I decided to try and make authentic sushi rice rolls, so I chose the full sheets. The packaging made it easy to find in the store and was relatively easy to open while remaining sturdy enough to protect the product. I was pleased with the number of seaweed sheets that came in the package and all of them were in good condition and were not dry or crumbly. When it came to the taste, I was not so pleased. I felt as though the sheets could use a lot more flavor. I offered a sheet to one of my coworkers, who also enjoys seaweed, and he felt similarly. It tasted fairly bland either by itself or with rice and filling, to the point where I had to add my own seasoning. Suggestions: I would have liked to see a vegan label on the Bacon variety, as the reason I passed it up was because I believed that animal products were used when that is not the case. It would also be nice to see the sushi nori sheets available in the same flavors as the snack sheets. I will likely try the seasoned varieties if I am able to find them in the store."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Carrie P.,",10-Nov-18,I received this product of Halo Brand Snacks for free in exchange for my honest review. The reason I'm giving this 4 stars is because they come in a tray and not a regular bag. This was my first time trying this type of product and they weren't bad at all. There wasn't an overpowering smell or taste. I tried the sea salt to be on the safe side with the flavors and the taste wasn't too salty just right.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"David H.,",27-Oct-18,When I opened the package I had my doubts about the product's taste because it looked too healthy to taste good. I was completely wrong! This is a delicious snack that made me want to try the rest of the Ocean's Halo products. This is a low calorie product that you can consume over and over again without feeling any guilt. I recommend highly recommend the bacon flavored Organic Seaweed Snacks.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Miranda R.,",04-Mar-19,"Personally, I did not enjoy the taste of the sea salt seaweed snacks. They had a very fishy taste, and considering I'm not a huge fan of seafood, I did not find them particularly enjoyable. However, if you are a fan of seafood, I could definitely see how one could enjoy these. Inexpensive, worth a try!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Keara B.,",10-Jan-19,When I first chose these to sample I was very hesitant because I wasn't sure I would like them but why not? Well I'm glad I did because they were great I loved them they were so good. I will definitely buy them again. By the way I left my coupon home and decided to by them on my own. Great decision on my part. Thank you for putting me on with these Social Nature!
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Sara M.,",15-Nov-18,"My store only sold the sea salt flavor. With that being said, these were still awesome. I could sit and eat them like chips without worrying about a ton of calories and fat. They were crunchy, not like chips, but because they were fresh. My four year old ate these up and asked for more. He would probably eat every pack at once if I let him. We will get these for snack and hopefully try all flavors."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Judy J.,",24-Feb-19,"I enjoyed these snacks a lot. They were very tasty and they stayed fresh for a long time. I like that they offer many different flavors. Ive only tried the sea salt ones so far but can't wait to try some of the others. I definitely recommend this to my friends, family and co-workers"
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Mia S.,",28-Oct-18,"I got the Sea Salt flavor Organic Seaweed Snacks by Ocean's Halo. I have to say they were pretty good, better than I expected and even though I used it as a wrap, it was tasty enough to eat by itself. The packaging was pretty and kept the product fresh until opening. They may want to consider doing a resealable pack, or reusable container for max freshness."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Javier F.,",28-Feb-19,I tried the sea salt flavor. it was really rich in flavor but not overpowering which is what I originally expected. The texture was a bit different but its easy to get used to. I would definitely buy again and Im excited to try the different flavors.
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Aimee B.,",05-Dec-18,"I wasn't sure if I was going to like this, but the flavor is actually appealing! Good brand and product(s), with a wide variety of flavors to choose from that should please any palate!! Seaweed is also good for people, like myself, with hypothyroidism, so I would definitely recommend this brand for others to try..."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Kimberly M.,",29-Oct-18,"I tried the Sea Salt Ocean's Halo, since that was the only flavor the store near me carried, and it was really good! The seaweed snacks have a nice crispiness to them and a great flavor, even for the basic ""sea salt"" variety. I eat a lot of seaweed snacks, and these were one of the better ones. I will definitely look around for the other flavors, because they offer so many that sound tasty."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Sarah H.,",26-Nov-18,My family says 5 stars without a doubt until I unveiled the source of our mystery snack and as I expected my little one took a star a way and I agree that the name and packaging leaves us wanting but surprised again that nature wins the flavor. I just feel better and wasn't immediately hungry for a snickers. Thank you for our family fun today.
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jennifer H.,",13-Jan-19,"It took me a while to find these in my grocery store; I had no problem finding the broth and soy sauce, but once they arrived I tried the Chili Lime and they had a great flavor! I was surprised that I really enjoyed these! I look forward to trying Wasabi!"
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Indya W.,",06-Dec-18,"These snacks are absolutely delicious! At first I was weary of trying some of the products (specifically, bacon) because I wasn't quite sure if it was made with animal products (Spoiler alert: they weren't!). The only thing disappointing about the product is that the amount they come in is not really a sharing size. Be weary when breaking them out around others!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Laura R.,",09-Jan-19,i loved this my son wants to get some for his gym buddies i have told all mt friends and they liked them as well The best thing that I thought was the best is that my health nut son of mine wanted them and said he was gonna bring some to the gym for his buddies. That is a big plus because those guys are hungry when they are done working out. They will love these snacks thats for sure. #tryit #gotitfree.......
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Rita H.,",16-Nov-18,I surprisingly loved the organic seaweed snacks. I loved the sea salt flavor and texture. The fact that they are non gmo and full of b-12 is great. I'm hooked for sure they are great for you and taste amazing! Thank you socialnature for the free sample.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"MaryAnn M.,",26-Nov-18,"I am so surprised about the taste, it is not what you expect when you see seaweed snack. It is really delicious and I love that it is a healthy snack that I can even give to my granddaughter who is only a year and a half years old. She loves it. I would much rather give her this healthy snack than give her chips. I truly recommend that you try this product if you would rather eat something that is good for you."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Rachael V.,",27-Nov-18,"My daughter is a huge seawood snacker, she was very excited to see the great options Ocean's Halo offer for flavor! We tasted Chili Lime, Sea Salt, and Maui Onion. They were all very good, but my personal favorite is Maui Onion. It has this fantastic sweet after taste. The seaweed for Ocean's Halo also feels like it's more firm than other brands, it doesn't dissolve as quickly. We will be buying it again!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Vennessa G.,",28-Feb-19,"I have to tell you I really wasn't sure about these things at first but now that I tried them I am totally hooked. I went ahead and got me the Wasabi flavor ones and I am soo glad I did, they were delicious. I have since got the Korean BBQ and the Sea Salt and both are completely awesome. These products are a great healthy snack, easy to find and a great deal at my local market."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Tristann G.,",31-Oct-18,My husband and I really loved these seafood snacks. There was no fishy taste and the seasonings added a nice flavoring without being overpowering or fake. The bacon flavor was our favorite. I recommend these for everyone who enjoys seaweed snacks and wants a variety of flavors.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"DON S.,",29-Nov-18,"at first i was hesitant about trying the Oceans Halo seaweed product, just by the mere sound of it. im glad i did!! the taste was nothing as i imagined, it had an incredible taste, and knowing that it is good for me as well, its a no-brainer. i would suggest this to all my friends and to those, like me, that are afraid to try......do!! you will be pleasantly surprised."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Robyn H.,",25-Nov-18,"The sea salt Ocean's Halo Organic Seaweed snack taste as good as you would expect any other seaweed snack. I found it to be very tasty except for the fact that it was a little too salty. But other than that I have nothing negative to say about this snack. I love how light, thin and crispy they are, but they are also very flavorful. I will buy these again. I love seaweed snacks."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Sally S.,",15-Nov-18,I really enjoyed this product. Not what I expected. Simple clean essential product delivers quality with flavor. I thought it would be a good nutrient dense product but flavor would lack. Great flavor! I was happy to try this product and looking forward to trying other flavors
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Pehrie N.,",19-Nov-18,"These are lovely! Light, crispy, and very satisfying. The ""bacon"" flavor is more like a light smokyness, but I actually prefer it that way. They are well salted/flavored but it's not too much like some flavorings can be. Definitely have a satisfying crunch and are a great replacement for chips if you're trying to eat healthier."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Olga G.,",27-Feb-19,Great product that is not only delicious to the palate but of great health benefits to your overall well being. When buying organic halo products you're not just buying for taste you're buying for great health for life. And that right there....says alot.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Tamara W.,",29-Nov-18,"I really liked the Oceans Halo Korean BBQ Seaweed Snacks. They were very tasty and healthy for me. I have already told my family and my friends about these delicious snacks. I have went out and bought the Oceans Halo Chili Lime & Sea Salt Seaweed Snacks. I have told others to #gotitfree, #trynatural, #@socialnature, #OceansHalo."
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Shaniqua W.,",22-Dec-18,I think that this product is probably one of the healthiest and best options for my diet right now but I could not get past the taste. I usually dont dabble in areas I'm not extremely familiar with but it was worth the try. I'll need to try a different recipe next time then maybe things will be better.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Gail R.,",11-Mar-19,I received my free coupon from social nature to try their products. I tried the Miso noodle bowl with savory kelp broth and tofu it was delicious very tasty clean broth definitely a different way to try a ramen much better not as saltythe #trynatural #gotitfree noodles were really good. I would recommend it for a friend to try all organic which is definitely a plus very easy to cook you can add things to it like chicken was impressed will definitely try more of these products!!!!#
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Dawn K.,",06-Dec-18,"Great to have in your purse for when you are starting to get ""hangry"" I tried seaweed a few years ago that a friend had purchased, but I was not crazy about it. However, since this was a free sample I decided I had nothing to lose. I'm so glad I did! The taste was very subtle not ""fishy."" Tried the Sea Salt, was not disappointed."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Sonya F.,",31-Oct-18,"I didn't know what to expect, being skeptical about eating seaweed. It was just okay and I wouldn't voluntarily buy seaweed snacks again. The Korean and Texas BBQ, Maui Onion and Sriracha are great flavors and tasted great but each time I chewed a piece I couldn't help but visual dirty ocean water near the shore with even filthier foam and seaweed touching the sand."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Julie V.,",07-Dec-18,"I recently received a fantastic coupon book in the mail from Social Nature for Ocean's Halo products. I used one of the buy one get one free coupons to purchase 2 different flavors of their seaweed snacks. I got the chili lime and sea salt flavors. Both were delicious and nice and crisp! I happen to love seaweed snacks and these were great and available in a nice variety of flavors. I'm looking forward to trying other flavors and products from Ocean's Halo. Thanks, Social Nature!"
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Carissa Y.,",26-Nov-18,The seaweed snack is perfect for an afternoon pick-me-up snack but also a stellar addition to my lunch. What I usually do is to wrap my rice with the seaweed snack and make them look like tiny sushi rolls. This always helps elevate the flavor of the veggies in my lunch and make it more fun to enjoy.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Tammy W.,",26-Nov-18,"We tried the bacon flavor because let's be honest, who doesn't love bacon?? I was hesitant as its seaweed and not a normal staple in our household but boy am I glad we tried this product . It was deliciously flavored, had the perfect crunch and get this...my kids loved them!!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Cathy D.,",20-Nov-18,"We are real fans of sushi so when I first heard about your organic seaweed snacks I just had to give them a try. I had the sea salt flavor and the flavor is amazing, not to salty with a light crispy chip. I will definitely be getting more and look forward to trying the other flavors"
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Cassi S.,",25-Nov-18,"I attempted my first soup with the Pho Broth, kind of a east meets west Chicken Noodle Pho. While I kind of overdid it in the spice department, I believe that Ocean's Halo's broths have a lot of potential as a base for making soups. I can't wait to try the rest of their products over the next year!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"tiffany V.,",12-Jan-19,"Kim (seaweed snacks) are a staple in my home. My SO is Korean, so you understand. These were great! We tried the bacon, wasabi, Texas BBQ and Korean BBQ. The wasabi and Korean were my favorites, the bacon was good, but the taste was not all there, very light. I normally eat these with soup+rice and snacks on the go, especially at work."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Rita C.,",11-Mar-19,"These organic seaweed snacks are really no different than the other brands out there. I always feel hesitant to eat these, because all the packaging makes it feel quite wasteful. The taste is more or less the same as other brands, though it is a bit less greasy. I am tempted to try the Bacon flavor, though!"
5,ever take a dare?,"OrdinaryShopper,",01-Sep-18,"You know you never know you will or will not like something new to try unless you step out of your comfort level and just take a chance. This is lite, crispy, not messy, can't melt. Tasty enough to want to share with everyone, and yet share with no one. You will be delighted when you share and they say yuck! Now you have it to yourself, better than crackers, and less cost than a bar of chocolate. Why not try it, I dare you!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Elizabeth H.,",04-Dec-18,These are a great snack if you are looking for something a little salty but still healthy. I grew up eating different kinds of seaweed but I love the fact that these are so easy to take along and still satisfying. The store I got them at had a very limited selection so I would love to find a store that had more choices available.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Kat W.,",07-Dec-18,I tried the sea salt version of oceans halo organic seaweed snacks. I have had seaweed snacks like this before and enjoy them. Oceans halo's seaweed snacks were delicious! The light airy texture with a slight crunch was perfect and the flavoring was perfect. Just enough of a light sea salt taste without being overpowering. I would definitely recommend these to those who already love seaweed snacks and to those who are curious but hesitant about trying a product like this. They are amazing!
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jennifer S.,",22-Jan-19,"I really liked trying the Ocean's Halo seaweed snacks! I was really very surprised by how tasty it was. I had some hesitancy because although I like seaweed in sushi, I was not confident that I would like it on its own. I am glad I tried it, I plan to make this brand a new regular purchase in my household and decrease the other crunchy snacks normally purchased such as chips."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Carie A.,",12-Jan-19,Absolutely wonderful. I loved it and will buy regularly. Nice taste and healthy. I was surprised a healthy product could be so tasty. My whole family loves this.
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Brittany E.,",15-Jan-19,It was really good like a little flaky chip. My kids loved them they ate the most. I would definitely try it again. I was surprised it didn't leave an after taste. All in all good tasting and light.
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Meghan F.,",22-Nov-18,"I absolutely love these seaweed snacks!!! I'm a big sushi lover and the nori is a great snack alone. I also picked up a couple extra packs and added them to my meal of sticky rice and salmon and made mini seaweed wraps, Yum!!!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Erika R.,",09-Nov-18,I really loved the variety of flavors they had! It's so nice to find a healthy snack with low calories! Tastes super healthy just like what they roll sushi in
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Kristina G.,",15-Nov-18,"This was a very satisfying/tasty snack. The packaging is good for on-the-go eating. Other brands are usually too oily for me in texture, but this one was not! The taste is also not too salty. Can't wait to try more flavors!"
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Danielle P.,",11-Mar-19,"I live for these, the chili lime is my absolute favourite. Perfect for snacking especially if you like chips because its a great supplement for chips because of the crunch."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Nikki C.,",04-Nov-18,I love the saltiness. It was crispy and tasted just right. Not too overpowering and very healthy. My fiance didn't like it but he doesn't really do healthy snacks.
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Rita V.,",12-Dec-18,Not for me. I do not like the taste or texture at all. Not for me. I do not like the taste or texture at all. Not for me. I do not like the taste or texture at all.
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Rachel H.,",10-Dec-18,I've tried seaweed like this before and was not a fan but these actually had a good flavor. I would definitely get them again. I tried the chili lime flavor. I think next time I'll try the Korean BBQ ones.

4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Ann G.,",14-Nov-18,"I tried Ocean Halos seaweed snack sheets ,seasalt flavor. I received a free coupon from social nature. I AM Surprised to tell you that I really liked the snack. I didn't think I would. Everyone should give them a try."
5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Sadi L.,",06-Dec-18,It was different than my normal snacks but it was good. I'd recommend everyone to try the product at least once or twice. I got the sea salt flavor I would purchase again definitely

5,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Nattlie M.,",28-Nov-18,I am extremely picky when it comes to seaweed products. This taste fresh and you can also taste the flavors not just the seaweed. It is crisp and really yummy. I will be buying this product all the time. Best that I have had.
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Galatea S.,",28-Nov-18,Cute compact seaweed snack sheets. Just perfect for portion sized snacking. The seaweed snack sheets are crispy with enough salt to give them a snap of subtle flavor.
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Andrea U.,",15-Dec-18,"I had the sriracha flavor which was very good! Only wish it had more of the toasted sesame oil on it, but still a great product! I will definitely be purchasing more flavors of seaweed soon!"
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Ashley C.,",26-Nov-18,The product was okay. The only one I liked was the sea salt. I would purchase those again. The Wasabi did not have a good flavor at all. The Texas bbq was alright but I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Candy S.,",25-Feb-19,"I didn't care for them but my family liked them.they have had me buy them again to try other flavors.i will buy again for my family,and recommend them to others."
4,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jaclyn B.,",05-Nov-18,We loved the flavor of the Sea Salt Ocean Halo Organic Seaweed Snacks. My two girls loved it when I put these in their lunches for one of their two snacks. I love how it's nice and crunch and just the right amount of flavor.
